    "text": "Online Resources\n\nSlack\nWe will use Slack as our main form of communication for the class. I will try to mirror the Slack Workspace that you had for 512/612. If you are unsure how to do a homework problem or have other questions, please ask myself or the TA’s either by email or posting your question(s) on Slack. Please know that Slack is not guarded by the OSHU firewall, so if you have a question about accommodations or any sensitive topics, you may wish to message me via email. You can still message me regarding sensitive information on Slack, but I will not initiate those conversations on Slack. Please continue to use the tips on asking for help that Meike laid out in the 512/612 syllabus. I will also add her tips to the Slack workspace.\n**Please use this invitation link for our Slack workspace!**\n\n\nSakai\nCourse materials will be delivered online through Sakai, OHSU’s course management system. This is where you’ll find all course materials (syllabus, videos, lectures, homework assignments, announcements, etc.). This is also where you’ll submit all course assignments.\nI will try to keep the structure of the Sakai page similar to that of BSTA 512/612. It’s always tough for you, the students, to spend two quarters with one faculty member then change to a new one. That is why I will try my best to keep the Sakai navigation similar. However, certain aspects will certainly be different. I hope we can work together to identify the things that are and are not working for our classroom. \n\n\nExplain Everything\nI plan to use Explain Everything on my iPad to deliver lectures. This application allows me to take real time notes, access Poll Everywhere, and record the lecture. I hope to use these features to allow you to follow me during lecture and have access to a recording for asynchronous viewing. While I will try to always make a recorded lecture available to you after class, I want you to try to attend class in person. I understand that life events get in the way on in-person attendance, but your attendance in-person brings me joy while I teach, and then further motivates me to be a great teacher. \nNote: I am new to this application so I ask you for some grace as I learn to navigate it. \n\n\nWebex\nWebex software will be used for office hours. To give everyone the best possible experience with Webex, we recommend the following best practices:\n\nPlease stay muted until you want to participate\nDuring office hours, please send a message in chat with your question or with a statement like “I have a question.” This makes sure I or the TA can address everyone’s questions in order. \nI encourage you to attend office hours with your video on. This helps me recognize you, and keep mental notes on what techniques/concepts I emphasize to facilitate your specific understanding. \n\n\n\nPoll Everywhere\nWe will use the Poll Everywhere tool as an interactive feature of the course. Poll Everywhere is a web-based application that allows students to participate by responding via text messages or by visiting a web page on an internet-enabled device (smartphone, tablet, laptop). Instructions will be displayed on-screen. The poll that is embedded within the presentation will update in real time. While there is no cost to use this software, standard text messaging rates will apply if you use your phone. Please make sure that you have a Poll Everywhere account before our first class. You are not required to use your OHSU/PSU email to make an account. \nDuring lectures I will pose questions to the class. These questions are designed to provide real-time feedback to both students and the instructor on how well students are grasping the material. This is meant to be an interactive, learning activity with NO contribution to your grade. Your identity will never be connected to your answers, so I encourage you to answer honestly.\n\n\nPennState STAT 414 Website\nPennState has a class offered to advanced undergraduates that has some overlap with our class. They have all their course notes posted on thispage. This is a great source if you would like to see class notes with different phrasing.\nNot all of our topics are covered in their notes, but the most important ones are. If you are having trouble finding our course’s concepts on their page, please make ask me at Office Hours, after class, or in a private meeting. I do not explicitly state corresponding sections under our schedule because I believe it is important for you to develop skills involving resources and learning key words that can help you find answers. \n\n\nR: Statistical Computing Software\nStudents will use statistical software to complete homework assignments. Students are required to use R/RStudio for this course. R can be freely downloaded. Helpful documentation on installing R is available. I encourage you to install R prior to attending our first lecture. Please email me if you need help installing R or RStudio.\nYou will need to download the following three things:\n\nR https://www.r-project.org/\nRstudio https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\nQuarto https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/\n\n\nAdditional R Resources\nYour learning and practicing of R will hopefully not be limited to this course. One of the best aspects of programming in R is that many resources are freely available online. Here are just a few additional resources you may explore beyond this class to continue your training in R.\n\n\nUseful online R resources\n\nR for the rest of us\nStatistical tools for high-throughput data analysis. ggplot2 essentials\nR-bloggers\nStack Overflow for troubleshooting\nR Graphical Manual\nQuick-R.

    "text": "Types of assessments\nThis class will use a combination of formative and summative assessments to build and test our knowledge. Below I define each of these types of assessments:\n\nFormative assessment: Activity or work meant to help students learn and practice. Grading of these assessments are meant to help the instructor and student identify gaps in knowledge and highlight accomplishments.\nSummative assessment: Work meant to test how well students have achieved learning objectives. Grading of these assessments are meant to gauge how well a student grasps the learning objectives and will be able to use their knowledge outside of the classroom.\n\nStudents will always have the opportunity to redo formative assessments until they are satisfied with their grade. That means students can redo homework and readings until they are satisfied with their grade. This is meant to emphasize the learning process, and reduce pressure for correctness. However, there are some limitations on “redoing” your work. In the homework grading scale (shown in Criteria), you might notice that certain grades correspond to a certain percentage of the homework completed. You can only redo problems that you have completely worked through. Thus, you can only increase your grade by increasing the amount of correct problems."

This class may not be a priority to you, you may be taking several other courses, or you may need to dedicate time to other activities. Homeworks are formative assessments, meaning its purpose is to help you learn and practice. To reduce the pressure on you to have perfect or complete homework, I have a very simple grading policy: Your homework will be given a check mark if you turn something in (whether it is incomplete, complete, correct, or wrong). I highly encourage you to stay up-to-date with the homeworks and put in as much effort as you can. This will be the most helpful work in this class!\nAfter the due date, either the TA or myself will post the solutions.\n\n\nViewing Grades in Sakai\nPoints you receive for graded activities will be posted to the Sakai Gradebook. Click on the Gradebook link on the left navigation to view your points.\n\n\nLate Work Policy\nI encourage you to make your best effort to submit all assignments on time, but I understand circumstances arise that are beyond our control. Please see this Swansea University’s page on extenuating circumstances for some examples. Not all circumstances are covered here, so please reach out if you have questions. \n\nEach of you will receive one “no questions asked” extension on any homework assignment. To request the extension, you can write an email with subject “Extension on Homework Assignment __” with body saying “I would like an extension on Homework Assignment __ for __ days.” I will grant you that extension with no questions asked.\n\nIf you have already used a “no questions asked” extension on homework, then homework grades will go down one point for every day it is late. For example, if your work is on par of a 5/5, but you turn it in homework 2 days late, then you will receive a 3/5. \n\nThe class will end on June 16, 2023. All coursework is expected to be completed by then. If you have extenuating circumstances, and need additional time to complete class assignments, please contact me. Together, we will come up with a plan for completion and to sort out registrar logistics.\nIf you have extenuating circumstances that may jeopardize your ability to do work for several weeks, please contact me. We will come up with a plan to keep you on track in the course and prevent any delay in your education.\nFor non-homework assignments, I ask you to email me directly. You can explain your circumstances and may ask me for an extension, but I won’t necessarily grant one.\nIf you have a emergency involving your self, family, pet, friend, classmate, or anything/one deemed important to you, please do not worry about immediately contacting me. We can work something out after your emergency. If I contact you during an emergency, it is only because I am worried, and you do NOT need to respond until you are able. \n\n\n\nRegrade Policy\nIf you think a question was incorrectly graded, first compare your answer to the answer key. If you believe a re-grade would be appropriate, write an email to me containing the question and a short explanation as to why the question(s) was/were incorrectly graded. Deadline: One week after assignments were returned to class (late requests will not be considered).\n\n\nAttendance Policy\nYou are expected to attend class and participate in class polls and the exit ticket. For students who miss class or need a review, I will make video and audio recordings of lectures available. There are no guarantees against technical or other challenges for the recording availability or quality. For students who are unable to attend the class in-person and synchronously, viewing the recording within 7 days is acceptable. Make sure to complete the exit ticket to demonstrate attendance."

    "title": "Outcomes, Events, and Sample Space",
    "section": "1.1 Introduction",
    "text": "1.1 Introduction\nThe introduction in this chapter starts with the following quote:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Probability theory is the study of randomness and all things associated with randomness.”\n\n\n\nI couldn’t say it better myself. There are examples with obvious hints at randomness (i.e. dice rolls, coins flips) and there are examples with not-so-obvious randomness involved (i.e. time until any given traffic light turns green).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 1.1\n\n\n\nWhen something happens at random there are several potential outcomes. Exactly one of the outcomes occurs. An event is defined to be a collection of some outcomes.\n\n\nOur goal in probability and statistics is to characterize randomness. Then as statisticians, we can use what we know about randomness to see if certain features of the world is within randomness or outside the randomness. For example, according to a New York Times article published on July 25, 2023, the Education Department is investigating Harvard University’s legacy admissions policy. Here is an excerpt from that article:\n\nHarvard gives preference to applicants who are recruited athletes, legacies, relatives of donors and children of faculty and staff. As a group, they make up less than 5 percent of applicants, but around 30 percent of those admitted each year. About 67.8 percent of these applicants are white, according to court papers.\n\nUsing probability, we can start to see why this practice might be inequitable. If these applicants make up 5% of the total applicant pool, and we completely, randomly chose applicants to admit, then we would expect 5% of admitted students to be this group of recruited athletes, legacies, relatives of donors, and children of faculty and staff. We could argue that recruited athletes are more likely to be admitted since they are, in fact, recruited, or that children of faculty and staff might “game” high school succesfully because they live in a home that subscribes to the academic world. If we want to compare the acceptance rate of 30% for this group to the average acceptance rate, the article actually fails to present a crucial peice of information: the average acceptance rate. I looked it up, and it is ~4%. So now we can start to think about questions like: With an average acceptance rate of 4%, does an acceptance of 30% of this group of recruited athletes, legacies, relatives of donors and children of faculty and staff make sense? We will explore this example further as we progress through our class.\nBaaack to our definitions: When we have several potential outcomes, and an event is a collection of outcomes, then we can start thinking of the set of potential outcomes. When there are no outcomes, then we have the empty set \\(\\emptyset\\). When we look at all outcomes, we call it the sample space \\(S\\). For now, when we look at a single event, we will focus on the sample space. When we start thinking of multiple events, the empty set might come into play. And just to reiterate: The empty set is an event. It is an impossible event, but it is still considered an event. So when you consider all possible events, the empty set is included. When you consider all possible outcomes, this is the sample space.\nNow let’s look at at an example with an obvious hint at randomness:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1.2\n\n\n\nYou roll a 6-sided die.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1.2 Explanation\n\n\n\n\n\nA 6-sided die has sides labelled 1-6. Thus, the sample space is \\(S=\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\) since we can land on any of the 6 sides. For every roll, only one of these outcomes occur, and that outcome is random.\nAn event can be any subgroup (more formally, subset) of the sample space, but not necessarily. Events can technically be outside of the sample space, but we often only consider events within the sample space.\nIf we can say our event is if we roll a 6, then our event is defined mathematically as \\(\\{6\\}\\). We can define a different event as rolling an odd numbered side, then our event is defined mathematically as \\(\\{1,3,5\\}\\). See TB pg 4 for more event examples.\n\n\n\nWe introduced subset, but here’s the definition:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 1.3\n\n\n\nEvent A is a subset of event B, written \\(A \\subset B\\). if every outcome in A is also an outcome in B.\n\n\n\nLet’s work on defining different types of events within sample spaces:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1.4\n\n\n\nA student buys a book and opens it to a random page. They note the number of typographical errors on the page. Let’s define the sample space and discuss one potential event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1.4 Explanation\n\n\n\n\n\nSince there must be 0 or more errors, and errors are counted with whole numbers, the sample space will be the set of nonnegative integers: \\(S=\\mathbb{Z}^{&gt;=0}\\). More plainly, \\(S=\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...\\}\\).\nHere are a few possible events we can consider: (I invite you to think of others if you’d like)\n\nevent that a page contains 4 errors\nevent that a page contains at most 3 errors\nevent that a page contains more than 3 errors\nevent that a page contains an odd number of errors.\n\n\n\n\nDefinitions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 1.11\n\n\n\nThe union of events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), denoted by \\(A \\cup B\\), contains all outcomes that are in \\(A\\) or \\(B\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 1.12\n\n\n\nThe intersection of events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), denoted by \\(A \\cap B\\), contains all outcomes that are both in \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)."

    "text": "Notes\nThere are a few things I’d like to address from the book:\n\nThere is a set of examples, 1.5 and 1.6, that talk about the birth of a baby. While this example is helpful for considering potential sample spaces, there is an oversight on the biology of births. The examples refer to the event of the sex assigned at birth (SAB). There are two issues in this example. First, SAB is considered binary in this example (I will get back to this). Second, the binary SAB is written as “boy” or “girl.” These labels have gender identity inherently attached to their meaning, and thus, the more accurate binary versions of these are “male” or “female,” respectively (“Assigned Sex at Birth,” n.d.). These are often denoted as “assigned male at birth” (AMAB) or “assigned female at birth” (AFAB). Going back the first issue, a binary representation of SAB does not cover all possible events. People can also be intersex, meaning their genitals, chromosomes, and/or reproductive organs are not exclusively AMAB or AFAB (“Intersex: What Is Intersex, Gender Identity, Intersex Surgery,” n.d.).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtension to Example 1.5 and 1.6\n\n\n\nYou can go back to these examples (TB pg. 5) and work through them with the more accurate representation of sex at birth. Please use the possible outcomes of AFAB, AMAB, or intersex."

    "text": "Muddiest Points\n\n1. Why is the number of possible events \\(2^{|S|}\\)?\nIn class, we were wondering why/if \\(2^{|S|}\\) is the general formula for calculating the total number of possible events. We were specifically wondering if the \\(2\\) came from the fact that we had two options (heads and tails) for our outcome. Let’s work through the example of a 6-sided die to explain this further. The sample space is \\(S=\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\). So is the total number of possible events \\(2^6\\) or \\(6^6\\) or something else? We can actually think about an event by using an indicator variable for each outcome of the sample space. An indicator variable is just a way to give us a yes/no answer to a question. So in this case, we are wondering: is this outcome a part of our event? If our event is \\(\\{1\\}\\) then for the outcome \\(1\\), the answer is “yes, the outcome is part of the event. For outcomes \\(2-6\\), the answer is”no, the outcome is not apart of the event.”\n\nFor each outcome, we have a “yes” or “no” answer. We can look at another example of an event. Let’s say our event is rolling an even number:\n\nFor \\(2\\), \\(4\\), and \\(6\\), the answer is “yes.” We can define the indicator variable for whether an outcome is in an event or not. The indicator gives a 1 or 0 for yes and no respectively.\n\nAs stated above, the \\(2\\) in \\(2^6\\) comes from the \\(2\\) options from our indicator. Each side has two options, and there are \\(6\\) sides. Thus, \\(2^6\\) possible events.\n\n\n2. What is an event??\nI think this will become clearer when we start thinking about events in the context of probability. When we think of events outside of probability, we may think of something we actually do or something that happens, like going to a concert or coming to class or missing the streetcar. In this case, we think of the event as the single thing (out of all the options) that actually occured. For example, if I’m taking the streetcar to class, I can think of two definitive options of what might occur: I miss the streetcar or I get on the streetcar. Only one of these things can occur, which I may call an event colloquially.\nIt is important to make the distinction with events defined within probability. Events are not necessarily a single thing that occurred. Instead it can be a collection of things that may occur. In the example of the streetcar, I can define my event to include both options. Thus, my event is that I make the streetcar or I miss it. Both of these things cannot happen simultaneously, but if I want to calculate the probability that I miss or make the streetcar, then it is helpful to have the event defined."

What value do you expect to get on a roll? :::\nSolution:\nRemark: Expected vs. actual outcomes\n\n\nDefinition 3 (Expected value). The expected value of a discrete r.v. \\(X\\) that takes on values \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n\\) is \\[\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\sum_{i=1}^n x_ip_X(x_i).\\]\n\nRemarks:\n\nThe definition holds if the r.v. \\(X\\) takes on countably infinitely many values \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots\\), as well: \\[\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} x_ip_X(x_i).\\]\nAnother way to define the expected value of a discrete r.v. is to do so at the \\(\\omega\\) level, where the \\(\\omega\\)’s are outcomes in the sample space:\n\nSuppose \\(\\omega_1, \\omega_2, \\ldots, \\omega_n\\) are the possible outcomes of a random phenomenon. If outcome \\(\\omega_i\\) causes the r.v. X to take on value \\(x_i\\) (meaning \\(X(\\omega_i)=x_i\\)), then \\[\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} x_i\\mathbb{P}(\\{\\omega_i\\}).\\]\n\n\n\nExample 4. Suppose \\[X = \\left\\{\n        \\begin{array}{ll}\n            1 & \\quad \\mathrm{with\\ probability}\\ p \\quad\\mathrm{(success)}\\\\\n            0 & \\quad \\mathrm{with\\ probability}\\ 1-p \\quad\\mathrm{(failure)}\n        \\end{array}\n    \\right.\\] Find the expected value of \\(X\\).\n\nSolution:\n\n\nExample 5. Suppose \\[X = \\left\\{\n        \\begin{array}{ll}\n            1 & \\quad \\mathrm{with\\ probability}\\ p \\\\\n            -1 & \\quad \\mathrm{with\\ probability}\\ 1-p\n        \\end{array}\n    \\right.\\] Find the expected value of \\(X\\).\n\nSolution:\n\nExample 6. Suppose I throw darts at a dartboard until I hit the bullseye, and that my probability of hitting the bullseye is \\(p\\). Suppose further that all of my throws are independent, and that the probability of a bullseye never changes, no matter how many times I throw a dart. How many times should I expect to have to throw the dart until I hit the bullseye?\n\nSolution:\n\nExample 7. A ghost is trick-or-treating. It comes to a house where it is known that there are 30 candies in the bag and only one is a watermelon Jolly Rancher, which is the ghost’s favorite. The ghost takes pieces of candy without replacement until it gets the watermelon Jolly Rancher. How many pieces of candy do we expect the ghost to take?\n\nSolution:\nRemark: Both examples are repeated random processes. They are fundamentally different though:\n\nThe bullseye example (6) is \"with replacement\" since the probability of success remains constant.\nThe ghost trick-or-treating example (7) is without replacement, and thus the probability of success changes with each trial."

Suppose an investigator plans a study with 4500 participants that are Veterans. How many women can they expect to be included? Your answer must be calculated by defining a random variable and showing how to calculate the expected value.\nCashews revisited. Recall from Chapter 10 #8, that a bowl contains 30 cashews, 20 pecans, 25 almonds, and 25 walnuts, and 3 nuts are randomly selected to eat (without replacement). Again, find the expected value of the number of cashews, but this time by defining the number of cashews as a sum of random variables."

    "text": "Online Resources\n\nSlack\nWe will use Slack as our main form of communication for the class. If you are unsure how to do a homework problem or have other questions, please ask myself or the TAs either by email or posting your question(s) on Slack. Please know that Slack is not guarded by the OSHU firewall, so if you have a question about accommodations or any sensitive topics, you may wish to message me via email. You can still message me regarding sensitive information on Slack, but I will not initiate those conversations on Slack.\n**Please use this invitation link for our Slack workspace!**\n\nTips on asking questions\n\nIf you are unsure how to do a homework problem or have other questions, please ask myself or the TA’s either by email or posting your question(s) on Slack. \nWhen reaching out for help for a homework problem, please include some context on what you have already tried.\n\nFor example, including a photo of your work thus far with an explanation of where you think you might be wrong is a quick way for me to look it over your work and help you troubleshoot. This helps me see what parts you already understand and which you need help with.\nIf you are unsure how to start a problem, look through your notes and the book for examples that you think might be similar. When reaching out, mention these examples and why you think they might be helpful, but also why you are still unsure on how to proceed.\nIf you only write something similar to “I don’t know how to do problem xxx,” then my response will be to ask you what you tried so far. Thus, it will be quicker for you to let me know this information right away.\n\nIf asking for help about a specific example that you don’t understand, please also provide some detail beyond “I don’t understand example xxx.”\n\nWhich steps of the problem do you not understand? You can refer to a line number, for example.\nIf you don’t understand the first step, do you understand the ones following it?\n\nIn general, when asking a question, please provide the homework number it is from along with the chapter and problem number. If it’s an example from the notes or book, an example number or slide number will help finding it.\nWant more tips on asking questions? This list below is a good start. It’s from https://www.weareteachers.com/8-ways-to-pose-better-questions-in-math-class/.\nFinally, if I don’t respond within a day and you need a response soon, please remind me by emailing or messaging me again.\n\n\n\n\nSakai\nWhile most course materials will be delivered online through this website, assignments will be turned in through Sakai, OHSU’s course management system. I will include a link on this website to the Sakai assignment page. \n\n\nExplain Everything\nI plan to use Explain Everything on my iPad to deliver lectures. This application allows me to take real-time notes, access Poll Everywhere, and record the lecture. I hope to use these features to allow you to follow me during lecture and have access to a recording for asynchronous viewing. While I will try to always make a recorded lecture available to you after class, I want you to try to attend class in person. I understand that life events get in the way of in-person attendance, but your attendance in-person brings me joy while I teach, and then further motivates me to be a great teacher. \nNote: I am new to this application so I ask you for some grace as I learn to navigate it. \n\n\nWebex\nWebex software will be used for virtual office hours. To give everyone the best possible experience with Webex, we recommend the following best practices:\n\nPlease stay muted until you want to participate\nDuring office hours, please send a message in chat with your question or with a statement like “I have a question.” This makes sure I or the TA can address everyone’s questions in order. \nI encourage you to attend office hours with your video on. This helps me recognize you, and keep mental notes on what techniques/concepts I emphasize to facilitate your specific understanding. \n\n\n\nPoll Everywhere\nWe will use the Poll Everywhere tool as an interactive feature of the course. Poll Everywhere is a web-based application that allows students to participate by responding via text messages or by visiting a web page on an internet-enabled device (smartphone, tablet, laptop). Instructions will be displayed on-screen. The poll that is embedded within the presentation will update in real time. While there is no cost to use this software, standard text messaging rates will apply if you use your phone. Please make sure that you have a Poll Everywhere account before our first class. You are not required to use your OHSU/PSU email to make an account. \nDuring lectures I will pose questions to the class. These questions are designed to provide real-time feedback to both students and the instructor on how well students are grasping the material. This is meant to be an interactive, learning activity with NO contribution to your grade. Your identity will never be connected to your answers, so I encourage you to answer honestly.\n\n\nPennState STAT 414 Website\nPennState has a class offered to advanced undergraduates that has some overlap with our class. They have all their course notes posted on thispage. This is a great source if you would like to see class notes with different phrasing.\nNot all of our topics are covered in their notes, but the most important ones are. If you are having trouble finding our course’s concepts on their page, please make ask me at Office Hours, after class, or in a private meeting. I do not explicitly state corresponding sections under our schedule because I believe it is important for you to develop skills involving resources and learning key words that can help you find answers. \n\n\nR: Statistical Computing Software\nStudents will use statistical software to complete homework assignments. Students are required to use R/RStudio for this course. R can be freely downloaded. Helpful documentation on installing R is available. I encourage you to install R prior to attending our first lecture. Please email me if you need help installing R or RStudio.\nYou will need to download the following three things:\n\nR https://www.r-project.org/\nRstudio https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\nQuarto https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/\n\n\nAdditional R Resources\nYour learning and practicing of R will hopefully not be limited to this course. One of the best aspects of programming in R is that many resources are freely available online. Here are just a few additional resources you may explore beyond this class to continue your training in R.\n\n\nUseful online R resources\n\nR for the rest of us\nStatistical tools for high-throughput data analysis. ggplot2 essentials\nR-bloggers\nStack Overflow for troubleshooting\nR Graphical Manual\nQuick-R. Accessing the power of R\nR for SAS, STATA, and SPSS Users\nggplot2\nLearn R 4 free\nJoin a local R user groups\nLearning Machines\n\n\n\nOnline R courses to complement or refresh material from class\n\nR for the rest of us\nCoursera: R programming\nedX: R basics\nData Carpentry: For Biologists\nData Carpentry: For Ecologists\nPsychiatric R\nR coder"

This class may not be a priority to you, you may be taking several other courses, or you may need to dedicate time to other activities. Homeworks are formative assessments, meaning its purpose is to help you learn and practice. To reduce the pressure on you to have perfect or complete homework, I have a very simple grading policy: Your homework will be given a check mark if you turn something in (whether it is incomplete, complete, correct, or wrong). I highly encourage you to stay up-to-date with the homeworks and put in as much effort as you can. This will be the most helpful work in this class!\nAfter the due date, either the TA or myself will give you feedback (on one or more complete problems) and post the solutions.\n\n\nViewing Grades in Sakai\nPoints you receive for graded activities will be posted to the Sakai Gradebook. Click on the Gradebook link on the left navigation to view your points.\n\n\nLate Work Policy\nI encourage you to make your best effort to submit all assignments on time, but I understand circumstances arise that are beyond our control. Please see this Swansea University’s page on extenuating circumstances for some examples. Not all circumstances are covered here, so please reach out if you have questions. \n\nThe class will end on December 8, 2023. All coursework is expected to be completed by then. If you have extenuating circumstances, and need additional time to complete class assignments, please contact me. Together, we will come up with a plan for completion and to sort out registrar logistics.\nIf you have extenuating circumstances that may jeopardize your ability to do work for several weeks, please contact me. We will come up with a plan to keep you on track in the course and prevent any delay in your education.\nFor homework, there is a due date posted, but you may turn in the assignment any time before the class ends. I will give you the check regardless of when you submit the assignment. However, if you would like feedback on the homework, you must turn it in on time OR email me asking for feedback for your late homework.\nFor non-homework assignments, I ask you to email me directly. You can explain your circumstances and may ask me for an extension, but I won’t necessarily grant one.\nIf you have a emergency involving your self, family, pet, friend, classmate, or anything/one deemed important to you, please do not worry about immediately contacting me. We can work something out after your emergency. If I contact you during an emergency, it is only because I am worried, and you do NOT need to respond until you are able. \n\n\n\nRegrade Policy\nIf you think a question was incorrectly graded, first compare your answer to the answer key. If you believe a re-grade would be appropriate, write an email to me containing the question and a short explanation as to why the question(s) was/were incorrectly graded. Deadline: One week after assignments were returned to class (late requests will not be considered).\n\n\nAttendance Policy\nYou are expected to attend class and participate in-class polls and the exit ticket. For students who miss class or need a review, I will make video and audio recordings of lectures available. There are no guarantees against technical or other challenges for the recording availability or quality. For students who are unable to attend the class in-person and synchronously, viewing the recording within 7 days is acceptable. This is meant to keep you on track within the course and prevent a pile up of material. Make sure to complete the exit ticket to demonstrate attendance."

Examples of ongoing feedback are:\n\nNicky talks a little fast during lecture time. May you speak slower?\nDuring Office Hours, Dr. Wakim made a face when I asked a question. This face made me feel self-conscious about my question.\nDr. W asked me a question about my experience that made me feel like a monolith for my race.

Professional interactions are expected.\nBuild rapport\nIf you find that you have any trouble keeping up with assignments or other aspects of the course, make sure you let me know as early as possible. As you will find, building rapport and effective relationships are key to becoming an effective professional. Make sure that you are proactive in informing me when difficulties arise during the semester so that I can help you find a solution.\nComplete assignments\nAll assignments for this course will be submitted electronically through Sakai unless otherwise instructed.  I encourage you to make your best effort to submit all assignments on time, but I understand that sometimes circumstances arise that are beyond our control. If you need an extension, please contact me in congruence with the Late Policy.\nSeek help if you need it\nI believe it is important to support the physical and emotional well‐being of my students. If you are experiencing physical or mental health issues, I encourage you to use the resources on campus such as those listed below. If you have a health issue that is affecting your performance or participation in the course, and/or if you need help connecting with these resources, please contact the instructor or any of the TAs.\n\nStudent Health and Wellness Center (SHW), Website, 503-494-8665 (OHSU Students only)\nStudent Health and Counseling (SHAC), Website, 503-725-2800\n\nInform your instructor of any accommodations needed\nYou should speak with or email me before or during the first week of classes regarding any special needs. Students seeking academic accommodations should register with the appropriate service under the School policies below.\nSome religious holidays may occur on regularly scheduled class days. Because available class hours are so limited in number, we will have to hold class on all such days. Class video recordings will be available and you are encouraged to engage with the material outside of the regular class time. You are also encouraged to come to office hours with questions from the session.\nCommit to integrity\nAs a student in this course (and at PSU or OHSU) you are expected to maintain high degrees of professionalism, commitment to active learning and participation in this class and also integrity in your behavior in and out of the classroom.\nCheating and other forms of academic misconduct will not be tolerated in this course and will be dealt with firmly. Student academic misconduct refers to behavior that includes plagiarism, cheating on assignments, fabrication of data, falsification of records or official documents, intentional misuse of equipment or materials (including library materials), or aiding and abetting the perpetration of such acts. Preparation of papers or homework, assigned on an individual basis, must represent each student’s own individual effort. When used, resource materials should be cited in conventional reference format."

Dobrow, Wiley 2013 (eBook available from OHSU library)\nAn Introduction to R (free pdf available from http://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html)\n\n\n\n\nOnline Resources\n\nSlack\nWe will use Slack as our main form of communication for the class. If you are unsure how to do a homework problem or have other questions, please ask myself or the TAs either by email or posting your question(s) on Slack. Please know that Slack is not guarded by the OSHU firewall, so if you have a question about accommodations or any sensitive topics, you may wish to message me via email. You can still message me regarding sensitive information on Slack, but I will not initiate those conversations on Slack.\n**Please use this invitation link for our Slack workspace!**\n\nTips on asking questions\n\nIf you are unsure how to do a homework problem or have other questions, please ask myself or the TA’s either by email or posting your question(s) on Slack. \nWhen reaching out for help for a homework problem, please include some context on what you have already tried.\n\nFor example, including a photo of your work thus far with an explanation of where you think you might be wrong is a quick way for me to look it over your work and help you troubleshoot. This helps me see what parts you already understand and which you need help with.\nIf you are unsure how to start a problem, look through your notes and the book for examples that you think might be similar. When reaching out, mention these examples and why you think they might be helpful, but also why you are still unsure on how to proceed.\nIf you only write something similar to “I don’t know how to do problem xxx,” then my response will be to ask you what you tried so far. Thus, it will be quicker for you to let me know this information right away.\n\nIf asking for help about a specific example that you don’t understand, please also provide some detail beyond “I don’t understand example xxx.”\n\nWhich steps of the problem do you not understand? You can refer to a line number, for example.\nIf you don’t understand the first step, do you understand the ones following it?\n\nIn general, when asking a question, please provide the homework number it is from along with the chapter and problem number. If it’s an example from the notes or book, an example number or slide number will help finding it.\nWant more tips on asking questions? This list below is a good start. It’s from https://www.weareteachers.com/8-ways-to-pose-better-questions-in-math-class/.\nFinally, if I don’t respond within a day and you need a response soon, please remind me by emailing or messaging me again.\n\n\n\n\nSakai\nWhile most course materials will be delivered online through this website, assignments will be turned in through Sakai, OHSU’s course management system. I will include a link on this website to the Sakai assignment page. \n\n\nExplain Everything\nI plan to use Explain Everything on my iPad to deliver lectures. This application allows me to take real-time notes, access Poll Everywhere, and record the lecture. I hope to use these features to allow you to follow me during lecture and have access to a recording for asynchronous viewing. While I will try to always make a recorded lecture available to you after class, I want you to try to attend class in person. I understand that life events get in the way of in-person attendance, but your attendance in-person brings me joy while I teach, and then further motivates me to be a great teacher. \nNote: I am new to this application so I ask you for some grace as I learn to navigate it. \n\n\nWebex\nWebex software will be used for virtual office hours. To give everyone the best possible experience with Webex, we recommend the following best practices:\n\nPlease stay muted until you want to participate\nDuring office hours, please send a message in chat with your question or with a statement like “I have a question.” This makes sure I or the TA can address everyone’s questions in order. \nI encourage you to attend office hours with your video on. This helps me recognize you, and keep mental notes on what techniques/concepts I emphasize to facilitate your specific understanding. \n\n\n\nPoll Everywhere\nWe will use the Poll Everywhere tool as an interactive feature of the course. Poll Everywhere is a web-based application that allows students to participate by responding via text messages or by visiting a web page on an internet-enabled device (smartphone, tablet, laptop). Instructions will be displayed on-screen. The poll that is embedded within the presentation will update in real time. While there is no cost to use this software, standard text messaging rates will apply if you use your phone. Please make sure that you have a Poll Everywhere account before our first class. You are not required to use your OHSU/PSU email to make an account. \nDuring lectures I will pose questions to the class. These questions are designed to provide real-time feedback to both students and the instructor on how well students are grasping the material. This is meant to be an interactive, learning activity with NO contribution to your grade. Your identity will never be connected to your answers, so I encourage you to answer honestly.\n\n\nPennState STAT 414 Website\nPennState has a class offered to advanced undergraduates that has some overlap with our class. They have all their course notes posted on thispage. This is a great source if you would like to see class notes with different phrasing.\nNot all of our topics are covered in their notes, but the most important ones are. If you are having trouble finding our course’s concepts on their page, please make ask me at Office Hours, after class, or in a private meeting. I do not explicitly state corresponding sections under our schedule because I believe it is important for you to develop skills involving resources and learning key words that can help you find answers. \n\n\nR: Statistical Computing Software\nStudents will use statistical software to complete homework assignments. Students are required to use R/RStudio for this course. R can be freely downloaded. Helpful documentation on installing R is available. I encourage you to install R prior to attending our first lecture. Please email me if you need help installing R or RStudio.\nYou will need to download the following three things:\n\nR https://www.r-project.org/\nRstudio https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\nQuarto https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/\n\n\nAdditional R Resources\nYour learning and practicing of R will hopefully not be limited to this course. One of the best aspects of programming in R is that many resources are freely available online. Here are just a few additional resources you may explore beyond this class to continue your training in R.\n\n\nUseful online R resources\n\nR for the rest of us\nStatistical tools for high-throughput data analysis. ggplot2 essentials\nR-bloggers\nStack Overflow for troubleshooting\nR Graphical Manual\nQuick-R.

    "section": "Assessment",
    "text": "Assessment\nThe course is structured around the following four components:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nModality\nFrequency\nDescription\n\n\nLecture\nIn person\nTwice, Weekly\nCourse content is provided through in-person lectures. Lectures will consist of didactic lessons, interactive examples, and PollEverywhere questions. Sessions will be recorded through Explain Everything and posted to Sakai. Attending or viewing the lecture within 7 days of the original lecture date is mandatory. Class attendance will be taken through an Exit Ticket. If viewing the lecture asynchronously, you must take the Exit Ticket to verify your attendance.\n\n\nHomework\nOnline\nWeekly\nThe course includes 6 homework assignments. They are an opportunity for you to engage with important concepts, practice coding, and apply calculating skills. Homework assignments should be submitted online, and will be graded by TAs. Students are encouraged to work in groups for homework assignments, but each person should do their own summary and hand in their work. Homework assignments will be due on Thursday at 11 PM.\n\n\nMidterm Exam\nIn person\nOnce\nThe purpose of the midterm is to assess how well you have achieved the learning objectives through questions covering important concepts, conducting statistical processes, and interpreting output. We will have our midterm in-class, and it will be open book. Students must work on the exam independently.\n\n\nFinal Exam\nIn person\nOnce\nThe purpose of the final is to assess how well you have achieved the learning objectives through questions covering important concepts, conducting statistical processes, and interpreting output. We will have our final in-class, and it will be open book. Students must work on the exam independently. While the final exam is not explicitly cumulative, certain topics learned before the midterm will carry over to material in the later part of the course.\n\n\n\n\nTypes of assessments\nThis class will use a combination of formative and summative assessments to build and test our knowledge. Below I define each of these types of assessments:\n\nFormative assessment: Activity or work meant to help students learn and practice. Feedback on these assessments are meant to help the instructor and student identify gaps in knowledge and highlight accomplishments.\nSummative assessment: Work meant to test how well students have achieved learning objectives. Grading of these assessments are meant to gauge how well a student grasps the learning objectives and will be able to use their knowledge outside of the classroom.\n\n\n\nBreakdown\n\nGrading & Requirements\nLetter grades will be assigned roughly according to the following scheme: A (&gt;=93%), A- (90-92%), B+ (88-89%), B(83-87%), B- (82-80%), C+(78-79%), C(73-77%), C- (70-72%), D (60 – 69%), F(&lt;60%).\nGrades will be based on homework assignments, midterm exam, class “attendance”, and final exam, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse activity\nType of Assessment\nDue Date\nPercentage of final grade\n\n\nHomework\nFormative\nApprox. weekly\n55%\n\n\nPost-class survey\nN/A\nTwice Weekly\n5%\n\n\nMidterm Exam\nSummative\n\n20%\n\n\nFinal Exam\nSummative\n\n20%\n\n\n\n\n\nCriteria\n\nHomework grading\nNo student has the same amount of time available to dedicate to homework. This class may not be a priority to you, you may be taking several other courses, or you may need to dedicate time to other activities. Homeworks are formative assessments, meaning its purpose is to help you learn and practice. To reduce the pressure on you to have perfect or complete homework, I have a very simple grading policy: Your homework will be given a check mark if you turn something in (whether it is incomplete, complete, correct, or wrong). I highly encourage you to stay up-to-date with the homeworks and put in as much effort as you can. This will be the most helpful work in this class!\nAfter the due date, either the TA or myself will give you feedback (on one or more complete problems) and post the solutions.\n\n\n\nViewing Grades in Sakai\nPoints you receive for graded activities will be posted to the Sakai Gradebook. Click on the Gradebook link on the left navigation to view your points."

This form will be available on Sakai. Students can submit feedback at any time and this form will be reviewed regularly by me. Your responses will be anonymous unless you elect to leave your email address. If I have done anything to make you feel uncomfortable, please give me feedback so I can change my behavior. Ultimately, this class is for you, and my individual social identity/behavior should not inhibit your learning. Thank you for your help making BSTA 513/613 a more successful class! Examples of ongoing feedback are:\n\nNicky talks a little fast during lecture time. May you speak slower?\nDuring Office Hours, Dr. Wakim made a face when I asked a question. This face made me feel self-conscious about my question.\nDr. W asked me a question about my experience that made me feel like a monolith for my race. Please do not assume I can speak on behalf of my social identity groups.\nThe in-class examples do not make me more interested in the material.\n\n\n\nMidterm Feedback\nDuring the middle of the quarter, I will ask you to submit guided, anonymous feedback. Completion of feedback will be count towards your midterm exam grade. To insure anonymity, I will ask you to sign a separate, written statement that you completed the feedback.\n\n\nFinal Course Feedback\nAt the conclusion of the course, you will be asked to complete a formal online review of the course and the instructor. Your feedback on this University evaluation is critical to improving future student learning in this course as well as providing metrics relevant to the instructor’s career advancement."

I want to walk through each class resource and assignment so that you know what you can do to succeed in this class. For resources, I want you to optimize the opportunities to learn. For assignments, I want you to know the strategies that students can use to learn the most and prepare for future exams.\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResource\nWhat is it?\nHow do I use it?\n\n\nOffice Hours\nBlocks of time where a professor or TA dedicates for questions. The teaching staff will be located in a specific room. Several students may enter the space at a time and will ask specific or broad questions. If many students attend office hours, a queue will be created so that students can be served equally.\nThe main use of office hours is to ask questions about an assignment or lecture notes. You are welcome to sit and do homework in office hours. OH are also an informal way of meeting fellow students to collaborate with.\n\n\nLectures and lecture recordings\nTime shared between the professor and students where the professor conveys important class material. Material discussed in lectures include concepts, calculations, code, and examples. Lectures are a mix of presentation of information, working through examples together, interactive activities, and in-class polls.\nStudents should attend lectures in person if possible. You should attempt to understand new material presented by following the presentation slides, taking notes on additional details that may conveyed verbally, and working through examples with the professor. Students are encouraged to ask questions when you don’t understand the material at any point in the lecture.\n\n\nTextbooks\nWritten and published material that explains concepts, steps through calculations, provides examples, and provides practice problems. The listed textbooks is the basis for this course. While I am to cover all topics in class, the textbook provides alternative explanations and additional examples.\nWhile coming to class having read the accompanying textbook chapters helps understanding during class, I do not expect students to have read it. I see the textbook as a good resource if you are struggling with a specific topic after class, in need of an example while working on homework, or want additional practice when studying for the exam.\n\n\nWebsite\nThe course website is designed by me so that you have access to all the course materials in a more organized and flexible way. All resources delivered from me to you will be available on the website. Any assignments turned in will be through Sakai.\nYou can navigate through different course resources and information using the left-side tabs or top navigation bar. Course materials, like lecture notes, homework, data examples, and recordings, can be found under each week’s page under the schedule tab. You can also find the individual resources under the “Course Materials” tab on the left. Links to turn in assignments through Sakai will be given on the website. Please explore the tabs and get a sense of the organization.\n\n\nSakai\nSakai is a learning management system for higher ed. This is the university sanctioned LMS where we will submit assignments.\nYou will turn in assignments through Sakai under the “Submissions” tab.

Please see this Swansea University’s page on extenuating circumstances for some examples. Not all circumstances are covered here, so please reach out if you have questions. \n\nThe class will end on December 8, 2023. All coursework is expected to be completed by then. If you have extenuating circumstances, and need additional time to complete class assignments, please contact me. Together, we will come up with a plan for completion and to sort out registrar logistics.\nIf you have extenuating circumstances that may jeopardize your ability to do work for several weeks, please contact me. We will come up with a plan to keep you on track in the course and prevent any delay in your education.\nFor homework, there is a due date posted, but you may turn in the assignment any time before the class ends. I will give you the check regardless of when you submit the assignment. However, if you would like feedback on the homework, you must turn it in on time OR email me asking for feedback for your late homework.\nFor non-homework assignments, I ask you to email me directly. You can explain your circumstances and may ask me for an extension, but I won’t necessarily grant one.\nIf you have a emergency involving your self, family, pet, friend, classmate, or anything/one deemed important to you, please do not worry about immediately contacting me. We can work something out after your emergency. If I contact you during an emergency, it is only because I am worried, and you do NOT need to respond until you are able. \n\n\n\nRegrade Policy\nIf you think a question was incorrectly graded, first compare your answer to the answer key. If you believe a re-grade would be appropriate, write an email to me containing the question and a short explanation as to why the question(s) was/were incorrectly graded. Deadline: One week after assignments were returned to class (late requests will not be considered).\n\n\nAttendance Policy\nYou are expected to attend class and participate in-class polls and the exit ticket. For students who miss class or need a review, I will make video and audio recordings of lectures available. There are no guarantees against technical or other challenges for the recording availability or quality. For students who are unable to attend the class in-person and synchronously, viewing the recording within 7 days is acceptable. This is meant to keep you on track within the course and prevent a pile up of material. Make sure to complete the exit ticket to demonstrate attendance.\n\n\nInstructor Expectations\nCommitment to your learning and your success\nI believe that everyone has the ability to be successful in this course and I have put a lot of effort into designing the course in a way that maximizes your learning to ensure your success. Please talk to me before or after class or stop by my office if there is anything you want to discuss or about which you are unclear. I want to be supportive of your learning and growth.\nInclusive & supportive learning community\nI believe that learning happens best when we all learn together, as a community. This means creating a space characterized by generous listening, civility, humility, patience, and hospitality. I will attempt to promote a safe climate where we examine content from multiple cultural perspectives, and I will strive to create and maintain a classroom atmosphere in which you feel free to both listen to others and express your views and ask questions to increase your learning.\nOpenness to feedback\nI appreciate straightforward feedback from you regarding how well the class is meeting your needs. Let me know if material is not clear or when its relevance to the student learning outcomes for the course is not apparent. In particular, let me know if you identify bias or stereotyping in my teaching materials as I will seek to continuously improve. Please also let me know if there’s an aspect of the class you find particularly interesting, helpful, or enjoyable!\nResponsiveness\nI will monitor email as well as the discussion board daily and try respond to all messages within 24 hours Monday-Friday.\nClear guidelines and prompt feedback on assignments\nI will provide clear instructions for all assignments, and a grading rubric when applicable. I will provide detailed feedback on your submissions and will update grades promptly in Sakai.\n\n\nStudent Expectations and Resources\nAttend class\nYou are expected to attend all scheduled class meetings synchronously or watch the recording within 7 days. Attendance is taken through exit tickets. If you have issues accessing the poll on a specific day, please let me know. \nParticipate\nI encourage you to participate actively in class and online discussions. I will expect all students, and all instructors, to be respectful of each other’s contributions, whether I agree with them or not. Professional interactions are expected.\nBuild rapport\nIf you find that you have any trouble keeping up with assignments or other aspects of the course, make sure you let me know as early as possible. As you will find, building rapport and effective relationships are key to becoming an effective professional. Make sure that you are proactive in informing me when difficulties arise during the semester so that I can help you find a solution.\nComplete assignments\nAll assignments for this course will be submitted electronically through Sakai unless otherwise instructed.  I encourage you to make your best effort to submit all assignments on time, but I understand that sometimes circumstances arise that are beyond our control. If you need an extension, please contact me in congruence with the Late Policy.\nSeek help if you need it\nI believe it is important to support the physical and emotional well‐being of my students. If you are experiencing physical or mental health issues, I encourage you to use the resources on campus such as those listed below. If you have a health issue that is affecting your performance or participation in the course, and/or if you need help connecting with these resources, please contact the instructor or any of the TAs.\n\nStudent Health and Wellness Center (SHW), Website, 503-494-8665 (OHSU Students only)\nStudent Health and Counseling (SHAC), Website, 503-725-2800\n\nInform your instructor of any accommodations needed\nYou should speak with or email me before or during the first week of classes regarding any special needs. Students seeking academic accommodations should register with the appropriate service under the School policies below.\nSome religious holidays may occur on regularly scheduled class days. Because available class hours are so limited in number, we will have to hold class on all such days. Class video recordings will be available and you are encouraged to engage with the material outside of the regular class time. You are also encouraged to come to office hours with questions from the session.\nCommit to integrity\nAs a student in this course (and at PSU or OHSU) you are expected to maintain high degrees of professionalism, commitment to active learning and participation in this class and also integrity in your behavior in and out of the classroom.\nCheating and other forms of academic misconduct will not be tolerated in this course and will be dealt with firmly. Student academic misconduct refers to behavior that includes plagiarism, cheating on assignments, fabrication of data, falsification of records or official documents, intentional misuse of equipment or materials (including library materials), or aiding and abetting the perpetration of such acts. Preparation of papers or homework, assigned on an individual basis, must represent each student’s own individual effort. When used, resource materials should be cited in conventional reference format."

I will copy these announcements in Slack if they do not involve changes to the schedule. Unfortunately, there are certain announcements that OHSU requires I initiate behind the firewall.\nGeneral course questions\nIt is normal to have many questions about things that relate to the course, such as clarification about assignments, course materials, or assessments. Please post these on our Slack Workspace. Please use the channels that I created for questions. You are encouraged to give answers and help each other. The TAs and I will monitor these threads, so I will endorse or correct responses as needed. Please give us 24 hours to respond to questions within Monday-Friday. Work-life balance is important for us as well, so we will try to respond as quickly as we can within our healthy limits. \nE-mail\nE-mail should be used only for messages that are private in nature. Please send private messages to my OHSU email address (wakim@ohsu.edu). Messages sent through Sakai Inbox will not be answered. Do not send messages asking general information about the class; please post those on Slack instead."

Leslie Bienen, MFA, DVM offers one-on-one writing support and other workshops. Appointments are virtual for the time being. You can make an appointment by contacting writingsupportsph@pdx.edu or making an appointment through Calendly.\n\n\nGrammarly Subscription\nThe School of Public Health students have access to a subscription version of Grammarly. While Grammarly cannot improve the argument and flow of your work, it can help with spelling, grammar, and sentence structure. If you are interested in this tool, please add your name to this email form and we will get you added to the subscription.  Be sure to use your PSU login credentials to access the form.\n\n\nStudent Wellness\nI am committed to supporting the physical and emotional well-being of my students. Both PSU and OHSU have designated centers for student health. For OHSU, students can visit the Behavioral Health site, where you can find more information including the number to make an appointment. All student visits are free. OHSU students also have access to PSU’s Counseling Services through the school’s Student Health & Counseling. Information on additional student resources for OHSU students are available on the OHSU Health and Wellness Resource page. \n\n\nSupport for Food Insecurity\nStudents across the country experience food insecurity at alarming rates. OHSU and PSU both provide a list of resources to help combat food insecurity. Of note, the Committee to Improve Student Food Security (CISFS) at PSU provides a Free Food Market on the second Monday of each month. OHSU also provides SNAP Enrollment Assistance. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) allocates money towards food for individuals below a certain income level. If you make less than $2,265 monthly, you may wish to enroll."

    "text": "Chapter 9: Independence and Conditioning - or, Joint Distributions\n\nDefinition 1. The joint pmf of a pair of discrete r.v.’s \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is \\[p_{X,Y}(x,y) = \\mathbb{P}(X=x\\ and\\ Y=y) = \\mathbb{P}(X=x, Y=y)\\]\n\n\nExample 2. Let \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) be two random draws from a box containing balls labelled 1, 2, and 3 without replacement.\n\nFind \\(p_{X,Y}(x,y)\\).\nFind \\(\\mathbb{P}(X+Y=3).\\)\nFind \\(\\mathbb{P}(Y = 1).\\)\nFind \\(\\mathbb{P}(Y \\leq 2).\\)\n\n\nSolution:\nRemarks: Some properties of joint pmf’s:\n\nA joint pmf \\(p_{X,Y}(x,y)\\) must satisfy the following properties:\n\n\\(p_{X,Y}(x,y)\\geq 0\\) for all \\(x, y\\).\n\\(\\sum \\limits_{\\{all\\ x\\}} \\sum \\limits_{\\{all\\ y\\}} p_{X,Y}(x,y)=1\\).\n\nMarginal pmf’s:\n\n\\(p_X(x) = \\sum \\limits_{\\{all\\ y\\}} p_{X,Y}(x,y)\\)\n\\(p_Y(y) = \\sum \\limits_{\\{all\\ x\\}} p_{X,Y}(x,y)\\)\n\n\n\nDefinition 3. The joint cdf of a pair of discrete r.v.’s \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is \\[F_{X,Y}(x,y) = \\mathbb{P}(X \\leq x\\ and\\ Y \\leq y) = \\mathbb{P}(X \\leq x, Y \\leq y)\\]\n\n\n\nExample 4. Find the joint cdf \\(F_{X,Y}(x,y)\\) for the joint pmf \\(p_{X,Y}(x,y)\\) in Example 2.\n\nSolution:\n\nExample 5. Find the marginal cdfs \\(F_{X}(x)\\) and \\(F_{Y}(y)\\) for Example 4.\n\nSolution:\n\nRemark: Some properties of joint cdf’s:\nIndependence and Conditioning\nRecall that for events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\),\n\n\\(\\mathbb{P}(A|B) = \\frac{\\mathbb{P}(A \\cap B)}{\\mathbb{P}(B)}\\)\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are independent if and only if\n\n\\(\\mathbb{P}(A|B) = \\mathbb{P}(A)\\)\n\\(\\mathbb{P}(A \\cap B) = \\mathbb{P}(A)\\cdot\\mathbb{P}(B)\\)\n\n\nIndependence and conditioning are defined similarly for r.v.’s, since \\[p_X(x) = \\mathbb{P}(X=x)\\ \\mathrm{and}\\ \\ p_{X,Y}(x,y) = \\mathbb{P}(X = x ,Y = y).\\]\n\nDefinition 6. The conditional pmf of a pair of discrete r.v.’s \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is defined as \\[p_{X|Y}(x|y) = \\mathbb{P}(X = x |Y = y) = \\frac{\\mathbb{P}(X = x\\ and\\ Y = y)}{\\mathbb{P}(Y = y)}\n=\\frac{p_{X,Y}(x,y) }{p_{Y}(y) }\\] if \\(p_{Y}(y) &gt; 0\\).\n\nRemark: The following properties follow from the conditional pmf definition:\n\nExample 7. Using \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) from Example 2:\n\nFind \\(p_{X|Y}(x|y)\\).\nAre \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) independent? Why or why not?\n\n\nSolution:\n\nRemark:\n\nTo show that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are not independent, we just need to find one counterexample.\nHowever, to show that they are independent, we need to verify this for all possible pairs of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\n\nExample 8. Hypothetical 4-sided die\n\nSuppose you have a 4-sided die, and you roll the 4-sided die until the first 4 appears.\nLet \\(X\\) be the number of rolls required until (and including) the first 4.\nAfter the first 4, you keep rolling it again until you roll a 3.\nLet \\(Y\\) be the number of rolls, after the first 4, required until (and including) the 3.\n\n\nFind \\(p_{X,Y}(x,y)\\).\nUsing \\(p_{X,Y}(x,y)\\), find \\(p_{Y}(y)\\).\nFind \\(p_{X}(x)\\).\nAre \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent? Why or why not?\nFind \\(F_{X,Y}(x,y)\\).\n\n\nSolution:\nExample 8 cont’d."

Similar to our class, the books integrate R into their lessons.\n\nA Progressive Introduction to Linear Models by Joshua French\nIntroduction to Regression Methods for Public Health Using R by Ramzi W. Nahhas\n\n\nSupplemental Readings (Optional)\n\nAn Introduction to R (free pdf available)\n\n\n\n\nOnline Resources\n\nSlack\nWe will use Slack as our main form of communication for the class. If you are unsure how to do a homework problem or have other questions, please ask me by posting your question(s) on Slack. Please know that Slack is not guarded by the OSHU firewall, so if you have a question about accommodations or any sensitive topics, you may wish to message me via email. You can still message me regarding sensitive information on Slack, but I will not initiate those conversations on Slack.\n**Please use this invitation link for our Slack workspace!**\nTips on asking questions:\n\nWhen reaching out for help for a homework problem, please include some context on what you have already tried.\n\nFor example, including a photo of your work thus far with an explanation of where you think you might be wrong is a quick way for me to look over your work and help you troubleshoot. This helps me see what parts you already understand and which you need help with. If your question involves code, please include the copied code (not a screenshot) and an attachment to your full file. This way I can see the exact line you need help with and the full code in case the problem starts earlier.\nIf you are unsure how to start a problem, look through your notes and the book for examples that you think might be similar. When reaching out, mention these examples and why you think they might be helpful, but also why you are still unsure on how to proceed.\nIf you only write something similar to “I don’t know how to do problem xxx,” then my response will be to ask you what you tried so far. Thus, it will be quicker for you to let me know this information right away.\n\nIf asking for help about a specific example that you don’t understand, please also provide some detail beyond “I don’t understand example xxx.”\n\nWhich steps of the problem do you not understand? You can refer to a line number, for example.\nIf you don’t understand the first step, do you understand the ones following it?\n\nIn general, when asking a question, please provide the homework number it is from along with the chapter and problem number. If it’s an example from the notes or book, an example number or slide number will help finding it.\nWant more tips on asking questions? This list on this site will help!\nFinally, if I don’t respond within a day and you need a response soon, please remind me by emailing or messaging me again.\n\n\n\nSakai\nWhile most course materials will be delivered online through this website, assignments will be turned in through Sakai, OHSU’s course management system. I will include a link on this website to the Sakai assignment page. \n\n\nExplain Everything\nI plan to use Explain Everything on my iPad to deliver lectures. This application allows me to take real-time notes, access Poll Everywhere, and record the lecture. I hope to use these features to allow you to follow me during lecture and have access to a recording for asynchronous viewing. While I will try to always make a recorded lecture available to you after class, I want you to try to attend class in person. I understand that life events get in the way of in-person attendance, but your attendance in-person brings me joy while I teach, and then further motivates me to be a great teacher. \n\n\nWebex\nWebex software will be used for virtual office hours. To give everyone the best possible experience with Webex, I recommend the following best practices:\n\nPlease stay muted until you want to participate\nDuring office hours, please send a message in chat with your question or with a statement like “I have a question.” This makes sure I or the TA can address everyone’s questions in order. \nI encourage you to attend office hours with your video on. This helps me recognize you, and keep mental notes on what techniques/concepts I emphasize to facilitate your specific understanding. \n\n\n\nPoll Everywhere\nWe will use the Poll Everywhere tool as an interactive feature of the course. Poll Everywhere is a web-based application that allows students to participate by responding via text messages or by visiting a web page on an internet-enabled device (smartphone, tablet, laptop). Instructions will be displayed on-screen. The poll that is embedded within the presentation will update in real time. While there is no cost to use this software, standard text messaging rates will apply if you use your phone. Please make sure that you have a Poll Everywhere account before our first class. You are not required to use your OHSU/PSU email to make an account. \nDuring lectures I will pose questions to the class. These questions are designed to provide real-time feedback to both students and the instructor on how well students are grasping the material. This is meant to be an interactive, learning activity with NO contribution to your grade. Your identity will never be connected to your answers, so I encourage you to answer honestly.\n\n\nPennState STAT 501 Website\nPennState has a class offered to online MS students that has some overlap with our class. They have all their course notes posted on this page. This is a great source if you would like to see class notes with different phrasing.\nNot all of our topics are covered in their notes, but the most important ones are. If you are having trouble finding our course’s concepts on their page, please make ask me at Office Hours, after class, or in a private meeting. I do not explicitly state corresponding sections under our schedule because I believe it is important for you to develop skills involving resources and learning key words that can help you find answers. \n\n\nR: Statistical Computing Software\nStudents will use statistical software to complete homework assignments. Students are required to use R/RStudio for this course. R can be freely downloaded. Helpful documentation on installing R is available. I encourage you to install R prior to attending our first lecture. Please email me if you need help installing R or RStudio.\nYou will need to download the following three things:\n\nR https://www.r-project.org/\nRstudio https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\nQuarto https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/\n\n\nAdditional R Resources\nYour learning and practicing of R will hopefully not be limited to this course. One of the best aspects of programming in R is that many resources are freely available online. Here are just a few additional resources you may explore beyond this class to continue your training in R.\n\n\nUseful online R resources\n\nR for the rest of us\nStatistical tools for high-throughput data analysis. ggplot2 essentials\nR-bloggers\nStack Overflow for troubleshooting\nR Graphical Manual\nQuick-R. Accessing the power of R\nR for SAS, STATA, and SPSS Users\nggplot2\nLearn R 4 free\nJoin a local R user groups\nLearning Machines\n\n\n\n\nOnline R courses to complement or refresh material from class\n\nR for the rest of us\nCoursera: R programming\nedX: R basics\nData Carpentry: For Biologists\nData Carpentry: For Ecologists\nPsychiatric R\nR coder"

Lectures will consist of didactic lessons, interactive examples, and PollEverywhere questions. Sessions will be recorded through Explain Everything and posted to Sakai. Attending or viewing the lecture within 7 days of the original lecture date is mandatory. Class attendance will be taken through an Exit Ticket. If viewing the lecture asynchronously, you must take the Exit Ticket to verify your attendance.\n\n\nHomework\nOnline\nWeekly\nThe course includes 7 homework assignments. They are an opportunity for you to engage with important concepts, practice coding, and apply calculating skills. Homework assignments should be submitted online, and will be graded by me. Students are encouraged to work in groups for homework assignments, but each person should do their own summary and hand in their work. Homework assignments will be due on Thursday at 11 PM.\n\n\nQuizzes\nIn person\nEvery 3 weeks\nThe purpose of the quizzes is to assess how well you have achieved the learning objectives through questions covering important concepts, conducting statistical processes, and interpreting output. We will have our quizzes in-class, and it will be open book. Students must work on the quizzes independently.\n\n\nProject (Labs and Report)\nOnline\n4 labs, 1 final report\nThe project will be a combination of submitted labs that will span the quarter and one final report submitted at the end of the quarter. This is meant to translate the tools learned in the course to the work one may do in the workforce. This will help instill the procedure for shaping research goals, model selection, analyzing data, and interpreting meaningful results. Labs will guide you through the needed analysis and background for the project. The final report will summarize your work over the labs and more closely align with a journal article. Students will work independently on each lab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of assessments\nThis class will use a combination of formative and summative assessments to build and test our knowledge. Below I define each of these types of assessments:\n\nFormative assessment: Activity or work meant to help students learn and practice. Feedback on these assessments are meant to help the instructor and student identify gaps in knowledge and highlight accomplishments.\nSummative assessment: Work meant to test how well students have achieved learning objectives. Grading of these assessments are meant to gauge how well a student grasps the learning objectives and will be able to use their knowledge outside of the classroom."

This form will be available on Sakai. Students can submit feedback at any time and this form will be reviewed regularly by me. Your responses will be anonymous unless you elect to leave your email address. If I have done anything to make you feel uncomfortable, please give me feedback so I can change my behavior. Ultimately, this class is for you, and my individual social identity/behavior should not inhibit your learning. Thank you for your help making BSTA 512/612 a more successful class! Examples of ongoing feedback are:\n\nNicky talks a little fast during lecture time. May you speak slower?\nDuring Office Hours, Dr. Wakim made a face when I asked a question. This face made me feel self-conscious about my question.\nDr. W asked me a question about my experience that made me feel like a monolith. Please do not assume I can speak on behalf of my social identity groups.\nThe in-class examples do not make me more interested in the material.\n\n\n\nMid-quarter Feedback\nDuring the middle of the quarter, I will ask you to submit guided, anonymous feedback. Completion of feedback will be count towards your grade. To insure anonymity, I will ask you to sign a separate, written statement that you completed the feedback.\n\n\nFinal Course Feedback\nAt the conclusion of the course, you will be asked to complete a formal online review of the course and the instructor. Your feedback on this University evaluation is critical to improving future student learning in this course as well as providing metrics relevant to the instructor’s career advancement (or lack of). Since our class is on the smaller side, everyone’s participation is needed for feedback to be released."

I want to walk through each class resource and assignment so that you know what you can do to succeed in this class. For resources, I want you to optimize the opportunities to learn. For assignments, I want you to know the strategies that students can use to learn the most and prepare for future exams.\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResource\nWhat is it?\nHow do I use it?\n\n\nOffice Hours\nBlocks of time a professor or TA dedicates for questions. The teaching staff will be located in a specific room. Several students may enter the space at a time and will ask specific or broad questions. If many students attend office hours, a queue will be created so that students can be served equally.\nThe main use of office hours is to ask questions about an assignment or lecture notes. You are welcome to sit and do homework in office hours. OH are also an informal way of meeting fellow students to collaborate with.\n\n\nLectures and lecture recordings\nTime shared between the professor and students where the professor conveys important class material. Material discussed in lectures include concepts, calculations, code, and examples. Lectures are a mix of presentation of information, working through examples together, interactive activities, and in-class polls.\nStudents should attend lectures in person if possible. You should attempt to understand new material presented by following the presentation slides, taking notes on additional details that may conveyed verbally, and working through examples with the professor. Students are encouraged to ask questions when you don’t understand the material at any point in the lecture.\n\n\nTextbooks\nWritten and published material that explains concepts, steps through calculations, provides examples, and provides practice problems. The listed textbooks is the basis for this course. While I am to cover all topics in class, the textbook provides alternative explanations and additional examples.\nWhile coming to class having read the accompanying textbook chapters helps understanding during class, I do not expect students to have read it. I see the textbook as a good resource if you are struggling with a specific topic after class, in need of an example while working on homework, or want additional practice when studying for the exam.\n\n\nWebsite\nThe course website is designed by me so that you have access to all the course materials in a more organized and flexible way. All resources delivered from me to you will be available on the website. Any assignments turned in will be through Sakai.\nYou can navigate through different course resources and information using the left-side tabs or top navigation bar. Course materials, like lecture notes, homework, data examples, and recordings, can be found under each week’s page under the schedule tab. You can also find the individual resources under the “Course Materials” tab on the left. Links to turn in assignments through Sakai will be given on the website. Please explore the tabs and get a sense of the organization.\n\n\nSakai\nSakai is a learning management system for higher ed. This is the university sanctioned LMS where we will submit assignments.\nYou will turn in assignments through Sakai under the “Submissions” tab. Generally, there will be a link to each assignment on the course website. You can also view your grades under “Gradebook” and links to Webex under “Webex.”\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment\nType of assessment\nBefore you submit/take it\nAfter it is graded\n\n\nHomework\nFormative\n\nWork out each problem on your own as much as you can\nTalk through problems with a peer\nGo to Office Hours for help\nWrite down work that shows your thought process\nSearch your issue on Stack Exchange/Stack Overflow\n\n\nReview the solutions\nReview your mistakes\nFor solutions that involve writing sentences, check with me or a TA if your answer fits the solution\nGo to Office Hours to ask about your solutions\n\n\n\nQuizzes\nSummative\n\nIdentify and achieve learning objectives in each lecture\nUnderstand why certain statistics tools are used for certain cases\nPractice testing yourself and others on concepts\nCome to Office Hours for help with specific problems or concepts\n\n\nReview the solutions\nReview your mistakes\nFor solutions that involve writing sentences, check with me or a TA if your answer fits the solution\nGo to Office Hours to ask about your solutions\nDo not ask for a regrade unless you have viewed the solutions\n\n\n\nProject Labs and Report\nFormative and Summtive\n\nStart the lab as early as possible\nWork on R coding and check with classmates on work\nCome to Office Hours for help with specific R work\nFor the report, compile your work from the labs, and decide what is important in the analysis.\n\n\nThis will be graded at the end of the semester, so you will not have a chance to interact with my feedback as much\nIf you have questions about your grade, you may email me\nKeep the project paper for future reference\nYou can add this project to your resume!\n\n\n\nClass Exit Tickets\nN/A\n\nBring appropriate electronic device to participate in polls\nComplete the survey during the last 5 minutes of class or after class within 7 days\n\n\nReview muddiest and clearest points from the week\n\n\n\n\nIf you would like any other course resources explained in this format, please request it through the Ongoing Course Feedback."

    "text": "Course Policies and Resources\n\nLate Work Policy\nI encourage you to make your best effort to submit all assignments on time, but I understand circumstances arise that are beyond our control. Please see this Swansea University’s page on extenuating circumstances for some examples. Not all circumstances are covered here, so please reach out if you have questions. \n\nThe class will end on March 22, 2024. All coursework is expected to be completed by then. If you have extenuating circumstances, and need additional time to complete class assignments, please contact me. Together, we will come up with a plan for completion and to sort out registrar logistics.\nIf you have extenuating circumstances that may jeopardize your ability to do work for several weeks, please contact me. We will come up with a plan to keep you on track in the course and prevent any delay in your education.\nFor homework, there is a due date posted, but you may turn in the assignment any time before the class ends. I will give you the check regardless of when you submit the assignment. However, if you would like feedback on the homework, you must turn it in on time OR email me asking for feedback for your late homework.\nFor non-homework assignments, including labs, I ask you to email me directly. You can explain your circumstances and may ask me for an extension, but I won’t necessarily grant one.\nFor labs, you will have ONE no-questions-asked, 3-day extension. Please use this wisely! You just need to send me a quick email saying “I am using my no-questions-asked extension for Lab __.”\nIf you have a emergency involving your self, family, pet, friend, classmate, or anything/one deemed important to you, please do not worry about immediately contacting me. We can work something out after your emergency. If I contact you during an emergency, it is only because I am worried, and you do NOT need to respond until you are able. \n\n\n\nRegrade Policy\nIf you think a question was incorrectly graded, first compare your answer to the answer key. If you believe a re-grade would be appropriate, write an email to me containing the question and a short explanation as to why the question(s) was/were incorrectly graded. Deadline: One week after assignments were returned to class (late requests will not be considered).\n\n\nAttendance Policy\nYou are expected to attend class, participate in-class polls, and complete the exit ticket. For students who miss class or need a review, I will make video and audio recordings of lectures available. There are no guarantees against technical or other challenges for the recording availability or quality. For students who are unable to attend the class in-person and synchronously, viewing the recording within 7 days is acceptable. This is meant to keep you on track within the course and prevent a pile up of material. Make sure to complete the exit ticket to demonstrate attendance.\n\n\nPlagiarism and Attribution\nPlease note that this section has been motivated by Dr. Steven Bedrick’s Course Policies and Grading site for BMI 525. (Note that this is a good example of informal attribution of someone else’s work.)\nIn this class, it is easy to use ChatGPT or other AI tools to solve your homework for you. Many problems follow a basic structure that is especially easy for ChatGPT to solve. In this class, you may use ChatGPT to help with your homework. You may even ask for direct answers. However, there are a few things I do not want you to do:\n\nDo not copy ChatGPT’s answer directly into your homework. Your homework is graded for full credit if you turn it in, in any state, so turning in ChatGPT’s answers is unacceptable. I rather see half-written answers that show what you’re thinking than see a correct answer from ChatGPT.\nDo not stop once ChatGPT answered a question. If it gives an explanation, interact with it! Make sure you understand the thought process of ChatGPT. Try writing out the process to help cement it in your head. Check the answer with what we learn in class.\nDo not use ChatGPT on our quizzes! Hence, you need to really understand how to solve these problems even if you use ChatGPT on the homework.\n\nAt the end of the day, ChatGPT is a resource that will be available to you in a job and outside of school. Thus, we should use it as a tool in school as well! Let me know if ChatGPT helped you understand something! I would love to incorporate it into future classes!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou can think of this class as assembling a toolbox. When a handyperson starts working for the first time, they need to buy their tools. For their first few jobs, they might need help finding their tools, or remembering which tool is best used for what action. Eventually, they get to know their tools well, and using them appropriately becomes second nature.\nFor now, ChatGPT can help us find and use our tools, but we need to work towards using them as second nature!"

Please talk to me before or after class or stop by my office if there is anything you want to discuss or about which you are unclear. I want to be supportive of your learning and growth.\nInclusive & supportive learning community\nI believe that learning happens best when we all learn together, as a community. This means creating a space characterized by generous listening, civility, humility, patience, and hospitality. I will attempt to promote a safe climate where we examine content from multiple cultural perspectives, and I will strive to create and maintain a classroom atmosphere in which you feel free to both listen to others and express your views and ask questions to increase your learning.\nOpenness to feedback\nI appreciate straightforward feedback from you regarding how well the class is meeting your needs. Let me know if material is not clear or when its relevance to the student learning outcomes for the course is not apparent. In particular, let me know if you identify bias or stereotyping in my teaching materials as I will seek to continuously improve. Please also let me know if there’s an aspect of the class you find particularly interesting, helpful, or enjoyable!\nResponsiveness\nI will monitor email as well as the discussion board daily and try respond to all messages within 24 hours Monday-Friday.\nClear guidelines and prompt feedback on assignments\nI will provide clear instructions for all assignments, and a grading rubric when applicable. I will provide detailed feedback on your submissions and will update grades promptly in Sakai.\n\n\nStudent Expectations and Resources\nAttend class\nYou are expected to attend all scheduled class meetings synchronously or watch the recording within 7 days. Attendance is taken through exit tickets. If you have issues accessing the poll on a specific day, please let me know. \nParticipate\nI encourage you to participate actively in class and online discussions. I will expect all students, and all instructors, to be respectful of each other’s contributions, whether I agree with them or not. Professional interactions are expected.\nBuild rapport\nIf you find that you have any trouble keeping up with assignments or other aspects of the course, make sure you let me know as early as possible. As you will find, building rapport and effective relationships are key to becoming an effective professional. Make sure that you are proactive in informing me when difficulties arise during the quarter so that I can help you find a solution.\nComplete assignments\nAll assignments for this course will be submitted electronically through Sakai unless otherwise instructed.  I encourage you to make your best effort to submit all assignments on time, but I understand that sometimes circumstances arise that are beyond our control. If you need an extension, please contact me in congruence with the Late Policy.\nSeek help if you need it\nI believe it is important to support the physical and emotional well‐being of my students. If you are experiencing physical or mental health issues, I encourage you to use the resources on campus such as those listed below. If you have a health issue that is affecting your performance or participation in the course, and/or if you need help connecting with these resources, please contact me.\n\nStudent Health and Wellness Center (SHW), Website, 503-494-8665 (OHSU Students only)\nStudent Health and Counseling (SHAC), Website, 503-725-2800\n\nInform your instructor of any accommodations needed\nYou should speak with or email me before or during the first week of classes regarding any special needs. Students seeking academic accommodations should register with the appropriate service under the School policies below.\nSome religious holidays may occur on regularly scheduled class days. Because available class hours are so limited in number, we will have to hold class on all such days. Class video recordings will be available and you are encouraged to engage with the material outside of the regular class time. You are also encouraged to come to office hours with questions from the session.\nCommit to integrity\nAs a student in this course (and at PSU or OHSU) you are expected to maintain high degrees of professionalism, commitment to active learning and participation in this class and also integrity in your behavior in and out of the classroom.\nCheating and other forms of academic misconduct will not be tolerated in this course and will be dealt with firmly. Student academic misconduct refers to behavior that includes plagiarism, cheating on assignments, fabrication of data, falsification of records or official documents, intentional misuse of equipment or materials (including library materials), or aiding and abetting the perpetration of such acts. Preparation of exams, assigned on an individual basis, must represent each student’s own individual effort. When used, resource materials should be cited in conventional reference format."

He was a statistician at UC Berkeley for more than 50 years. He was hired in 1954 after the department almost made him an offer in 1942 (but declined to do so when one faculty member’s wife said she didn’t want Blackwell hired because she wouldn’t feel comfortable having faculty events in her home with a black man). Hear Blackwell tell the story in his own words.\n\n\n\nTopics covered\nBlackwell contributed to game theory, probability theory, information science, and Bayesian statistics.

    "text": "Muddiest Points\n\n1. Why is the number of possible events \\(2^{|S|}\\)?\nIn class, we were wondering why/if \\(2^{|S|}\\) is the general formula for calculating the total number of possible events. We were specifically wondering if the \\(2\\) came from the fact that we had two options (heads and tails) for our outcome. Let’s work through the example of a 6-sided die to explain this further. The sample space is \\(S=\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\). So is the total number of possible events \\(2^6\\) or \\(6^6\\) or something else? We can actually think about an event by using an indicator variable for each outcome of the sample space. An indicator variable is just a way to give us a yes/no answer to a question. So in this case, we are wondering: is this outcome a part of our event? If our event is \\(\\{1\\}\\) then for the outcome \\(1\\), the answer is “yes, the outcome is part of the event. For outcomes \\(2-6\\), the answer is”no, the outcome is not apart of the event.”\n\nFor each outcome, we have a “yes” or “no” answer. We can look at another example of an event. Let’s say our event is rolling an even number:\n\nFor \\(2\\), \\(4\\), and \\(6\\), the answer is “yes.” We can define the indicator variable for whether an outcome is in an event or not. The indicator gives a 1 or 0 for yes and no respectively.\n\nAs stated above, the \\(2\\) in \\(2^6\\) comes from the \\(2\\) options from our indicator. Each side has two options, and there are \\(6\\) sides. Thus, \\(2^6\\) possible events.\n\n\n2. What is an event??\nI think this will become clearer when we start thinking about events in the context of probability. When we think of events outside of probability, we may think of something we actually do or something that happens, like going to a concert or coming to class or missing the streetcar. In this case, we think of the event as the single thing (out of all the options) that actually occured. For example, if I’m taking the streetcar to class, I can think of two definitive options of what might occur: I miss the streetcar or I get on the streetcar. Only one of these things can occur, which I may call an event colloquially.\nIt is important to make the distinction with events defined within probability. Events are not necessarily a single thing that occurred. Instead it can be a collection of things that may occur. In the example of the streetcar, I can define my event to include both options. Thus, my event is that I make the streetcar or I miss it. Both of these things cannot happen simultaneously, but if I want to calculate the probability that I miss or make the streetcar, then it is helpful to have the event defined."

    "text": "Muddiest Points\n\n1. Relationship between distributions\nJust to clarify! We will be using the distributions in the context of hypothesis testing. I just wanted you to see some of the cool connections between the distributions. (We don’t need to know the connections for a lot of what we do in this class.)\nAlso, I will discuss each distribution again as we hit the hypothesis tests that use them!\nThere is a big, scary (but fun!) infographic at the end of a famous stat textbook (Casella and Berger) that shows all the connections between distributions:\n\nWe mostly talk about the red, circled area. Each line with the directional arrow represents a specific transformation that is needed to go from the starting distribution to the distribution at the end of the arrow.\nAgain, this is NOT information we need to perform regression, but it is really interesting to see the connections between these distributions.\n\n\n2. A word about the distributions\nI feel like I might’ve scared us with all the distribution talk.\nI want to be clear: We will further discuss and explore the distributions as we use them within the course. It will be more important to understand their use within regression then knowing the distribution in depth. Basically, when we implement specific hypothesis tests, we just need to know which distribution is most appropriate for the test.\n\n\n3. Is the F distribution used for things outside of ANOVA?\nYes! In regression, we often use the F-distribution through the F-test (same as ANOVA) However, in regression, we are comparing the variance of two models, that may differ by a coefficient. See the STAT 501 page for more info if interested. In ANOVA, we are comparing variance between and within groups. Both use the same test, but with different goals!\n\n\n4. Multivariable vs multivariate?\nSome people misuse “multivariate” instead of “multivariable” modeling. In this class, we will only look at multivariable regression. Here’s the big difference:\n\nMultivariable: model with multiple independent variables (covariates, predictors)\n\nIf we want to see how our outcome (height) is related to parent height, birth country, sex assigned at birth, etc.\n\nMultivariate: model with multiple dependent variables (outcome)\n\nIf we want to extend the outcome from height to height and head circumference. Multivariate modeling would try to model both outcomes together and see how they are related to other variables.\n\n\n\n\n5. More on the functions and problems we had in class!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThis section has some examples from this YouTube video series. There is a video on mutate, pipe, filter, select, rename, arrange, and summarize. Note that some of the function in the series is outdated. The use of if_else() in the video is outdated, and it is more common to use case_when() now. The use of gather and spread have been replaced by pivot_longer and pivot_wider.\n\n\nTo discuss these functions below, I want to use a different dataset than what we used for examples in class.

If we wanted to ID the variables we wanted to remove, what variables would identify to get the same remaining variables that are in mtcars6?\nSo we want to remove the following variables:\n\nmtcars7 = mtcars %&gt;%\n  select(-hp, -drat, -wt, -vs, -am, -gear, -carb)\nglimpse(mtcars7)\n\nRows: 32\nColumns: 4\n$ mpg  &lt;dbl&gt; 21.0, 21.0, 22.8, 21.4, 18.7, 18.1, 14.3, 24.4, 22.8, 19.2, 17.8,…\n$ cyl  &lt;dbl&gt; 6, 6, 4, 6, 8, 6, 8, 4, 4, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8,…\n$ disp &lt;dbl&gt; 160.0, 160.0, 108.0, 258.0, 360.0, 225.0, 360.0, 146.7, 140.8, 16…\n$ qsec &lt;dbl&gt; 16.46, 17.02, 18.61, 19.44, 17.02, 20.22, 15.84, 20.00, 22.90, 18…\n\n\nSo both get the job done, but one is definitely quicker to type!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe don’t have to write the minus in front of every variable\n\n\n\nWhen we are removing several variables, we can combine them into a vector to remove:\n\nmtcars8 = mtcars %&gt;%\n  select(-c(hp, drat, wt, vs, am, gear, carb))\nglimpse(mtcars8)\n\nRows: 32\nColumns: 4\n$ mpg  &lt;dbl&gt; 21.0, 21.0, 22.8, 21.4, 18.7, 18.1, 14.3, 24.4, 22.8, 19.2, 17.8,…\n$ cyl  &lt;dbl&gt; 6, 6, 4, 6, 8, 6, 8, 4, 4, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8,…\n$ disp &lt;dbl&gt; 160.0, 160.0, 108.0, 258.0, 360.0, 225.0, 360.0, 146.7, 140.8, 16…\n$ qsec &lt;dbl&gt; 16.46, 17.02, 18.61, 19.44, 17.02, 20.22, 15.84, 20.00, 22.90, 18…\n\n\nThe vector above is: c(hp, drat, wt, vs, am, gear, carb) and the minus sign in front of the vector will be applied to each variable.\n\n\n\n\npivot_longer()\nI want to address the function with the faculty dataset from class.\n\n# Note, I've put the data in a folder \"data\" that is in the same folder as this page's file\nstaff = read_csv(\"data/instructional-staff.csv\")\nstaff\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 12\n  faculty_type    `1975` `1989` `1993` `1995` `1999` `2001` `2003` `2005` `2007`\n  &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Full-Time Tenu…   29     27.6   25     24.8   21.8   20.3   19.3   17.8   17.2\n2 Full-Time Tenu…   16.1   11.4   10.2    9.6    8.9    9.2    8.8    8.2    8  \n3 Full-Time Non-…   10.3   14.1   13.6   13.6   15.2   15.5   15     14.8   14.9\n4 Part-Time Facu…   24     30.4   33.1   33.2   35.5   36     37     39.3   40.5\n5 Graduate Stude…   20.5   16.5   18.1   18.8   18.7   19     20     19.9   19.5\n# ℹ 2 more variables: `2009` &lt;dbl&gt;, `2011` &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\nNote that I am not using glimpse() here because we only have 5 rows corresponding to the faculty type.

We want our data to be in a tidy format, which means each column is a variable and each cell has a value. However, the years are actually values for a variable “year.” By using pivot_longer(), we can tell R to take those columns for years and make them their own column where year is the value. That means for a year like 1975, there are five numbers corresponding to the five faculty types. Those five numbers are the percentage of the specific faculty type in that year. So we want to end with columns: faculty type, year, and percentage.\nTo start with an easier implementation of pivot_longer(), let’s remove the faculty type using select()\n\nstaff2 = staff %&gt;%\n  select(-faculty_type)\nstaff2\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 11\n  `1975` `1989` `1993` `1995` `1999` `2001` `2003` `2005` `2007` `2009` `2011`\n   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1   29     27.6   25     24.8   21.8   20.3   19.3   17.8   17.2   16.8   16.7\n2   16.1   11.4   10.2    9.6    8.9    9.2    8.8    8.2    8      7.6    7.4\n3   10.3   14.1   13.6   13.6   15.2   15.5   15     14.8   14.9   15.1   15.4\n4   24     30.4   33.1   33.2   35.5   36     37     39.3   40.5   41.1   41.3\n5   20.5   16.5   18.1   18.8   18.7   19     20     19.9   19.5   19.4   19.3\n\n\nNow we can pivot the years! We first identify the columns that we want to pivot. To pivot all the columns, we say cols = everything(). pivot_longer() knows you want the column names to now become values of a variable, but it does not know what to call that variable. So now we identify the new variable name of the column that will contain all the years (our old column names). We identify the new variable name with: names_to. Finally, we need to adress the old cell values that were under each year in our wide dataset. Those cell values will make up a new column/variable. Remember that each year had 5 values underneath it, so we need to include all 55 cell values. Similar to names_to, we need to identify the new column names for all those values. We use values_to to identify the column name for the cell values of our old wide formatted data.\n\nstaff_long = staff2 %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = everything(),    # columns to pivot\n    names_to = \"year\",       # name of new column for variable names\n    values_to = \"percentage\" # name of new column for values\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(percentage = as.numeric(percentage))\n\nhead(staff_long, 20) # I'm asking R to show me the first 20 rows\n\n# A tibble: 20 × 2\n   year  percentage\n   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 1975        29  \n 2 1989        27.6\n 3 1993        25  \n 4 1995        24.8\n 5 1999        21.8\n 6 2001        20.3\n 7 2003        19.3\n 8 2005        17.8\n 9 2007        17.2\n10 2009        16.8\n11 2011        16.7\n12 1975        16.1\n13 1989        11.4\n14 1993        10.2\n15 1995         9.6\n16 1999         8.9\n17 2001         9.2\n18 2003         8.8\n19 2005         8.2\n20 2007         8  \n\n\nI included the first 20 rows so we could see that the years repeat. This is because there were 5 percentages for each year. While this is in the desired long format, we now see that we’re missing the information on faculty type. Each percentage in each year corresponded to a specific faculty type:\n\nstaff_long %&gt;% filter(year == 1975)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  year  percentage\n  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 1975        29  \n2 1975        16.1\n3 1975        10.3\n4 1975        24  \n5 1975        20.5\n\n\nWhich percentage is for which faculty??\nWe could use another function called join() to try to remedy the situation, but it’s much easier to redo the pivot function. We will go back to staff which still has the faculty type:\n\nstaff\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 12\n  faculty_type    `1975` `1989` `1993` `1995` `1999` `2001` `2003` `2005` `2007`\n  &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Full-Time Tenu…   29     27.6   25     24.8   21.8   20.3   19.3   17.8   17.2\n2 Full-Time Tenu…   16.1   11.4   10.2    9.6    8.9    9.2    8.8    8.2    8  \n3 Full-Time Non-…   10.3   14.1   13.6   13.6   15.2   15.5   15     14.8   14.9\n4 Part-Time Facu…   24     30.4   33.1   33.2   35.5   36     37     39.3   40.5\n5 Graduate Stude…   20.5   16.5   18.1   18.8   18.7   19     20     19.9   19.5\n# ℹ 2 more variables: `2009` &lt;dbl&gt;, `2011` &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\nNow we can implement pivot_longer(). We will identify the columns we want to pivot as column 2 through 12 so we exclude the faculty type from the pivoting. BUT the really nice thing is that pivot_longer() will remember the percentages that correspond to a specific combination of faculty type and year! Let’s try it again:\n\nstaff_long2 = staff %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = 2:12,    # columns to pivot\n    names_to = \"year\",       # name of new column for variable names\n    values_to = \"percentage\" # name of new column for values\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(percentage = as.numeric(percentage))\n\nhead(staff_long2, 20) # I'm asking R to show me the first 20 rows\n\n# A tibble: 20 × 3\n   faculty_type                   year  percentage\n   &lt;chr&gt;                          &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Full-Time Tenured Faculty      1975        29  \n 2 Full-Time Tenured Faculty      1989        27.6\n 3 Full-Time Tenured Faculty      1993        25  \n 4 Full-Time Tenured Faculty      1995        24.8\n 5 Full-Time Tenured Faculty      1999        21.8\n 6 Full-Time Tenured Faculty      2001        20.3\n 7 Full-Time Tenured Faculty      2003        19.3\n 8 Full-Time Tenured Faculty      2005        17.8\n 9 Full-Time Tenured Faculty      2007        17.2\n10 Full-Time Tenured Faculty      2009        16.8\n11 Full-Time Tenured Faculty      2011        16.7\n12 Full-Time Tenure-Track Faculty 1975        16.1\n13 Full-Time Tenure-Track Faculty 1989        11.4\n14 Full-Time Tenure-Track Faculty 1993        10.2\n15 Full-Time Tenure-Track Faculty 1995         9.6\n16 Full-Time Tenure-Track Faculty 1999         8.9\n17 Full-Time Tenure-Track Faculty 2001         9.2\n18 Full-Time Tenure-Track Faculty 2003         8.8\n19 Full-Time Tenure-Track Faculty 2005         8.2\n20 Full-Time Tenure-Track Faculty 2007         8  \n\n\nAnd now I’ll just dump a couple other ways to identify the columns we want to pivot:\n\nIn this one, we name the column years. It’s like 2:12, but it’s helpful when it’s hard to see what number the column is. Also, this is a special case because the columns are numbers, so we need to use ’ to wrap around the year.

Are there benefits to ggplot compared to the base R graphing functions?\nThe main benefit I see for ggplot is that the syntax and grammar of our coding in tidyr and dplyr is very similar to ggplot. Your effort in strengthening one will help with the others.\nI am certainly not going to force you to use ggplot over base R. At the end of the day, it is really whatever makes the most sense to you. I will say: ggplot2 seems to be where most statisticians and epidemiologists are headed. And I really believe that ggplot is more efficient with coding."

    "text": "Muddiest Points\n\n1. What does the epsilon mean and how does it relate to the line in the linear model?\n\\(\\epsilon\\) is our error term, our residual. It is the difference between our observed value \\(Y\\) and the expected value of \\(Y\\) given \\(X\\). It’s a mathematical way to represent the fact that not every oberved \\(Y\\) value directly falls on our line. \\(\\epsilon\\) is the difference between our line and our observed value for \\(Y\\).\n\n\n2. Different betas and stuff: make the table for the class!! and epsilon\nBelow is a table that I started to construct with a student after class. We often use the model or the line to represent linear regression. When we refer to the model, most people think of the row named model. The line is just another way to represent the model. Remember that \\(\\epsilon = Y - E(Y|X)\\) and \\(\\widehat\\epsilon = Y - \\widehat{E}(Y|X)\\). Try substituting \\(\\epsilon = Y - E(Y|X)\\) into the population model \\(Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X + \\epsilon\\). Does it simplify to the population line?\nI think it can help a lot with this confusion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation\nEstimated\n\n\n\n\nModel\n\\[Y =  \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X + \\epsilon\\]\n\\[Y = \\widehat{\\beta}_0 + \\widehat{\\beta}_1 X + \\widehat\\epsilon \\]\n\n\nLine\n\\[E(Y|X) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X \\] OR\n\\[\\mu_Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X \\]\n\\[\\widehat{Y} = \\widehat{\\beta}_0 + \\widehat{\\beta}_1 X \\]\nOR\n\\[\n\\widehat{E}[Y|X] = \\widehat{\\beta}_0 + \\widehat{\\beta}_1X\n\\]\nOR\n\\[\n\\widehat{E[Y|X]} = \\widehat{\\beta}_0 + \\widehat{\\beta}_1X\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n2.1 Someone else asked: Why does the population model have an error term epsilon in the equation but the estimated line does not?\nI think this is referring to this slide. This was because I wanted to put the population model next to the estimated line. I realize this is very confusing. Both estimated and population models can be represented as the lines and models in the above table.\n\n\n2.2 Someone else asked: Why does the population equation even matter?\nHuh, I’m scratching my head with this one. Why does it matter? We basically mirror all the mathematical manipulations with the estimated model anyway…\nBut then I thought: What would our world or our class lectures look like without the population model? The answer might be more philosophical than mathematical. The representation of the true, underlying model that we are aspiring for with our sample data reminds us that our estimated model is not perfect. That we are just trying out best to uncover some fraction of the truth. And at the end of the day, when we perform hypothesis tests, we’re working to provide evidence fro the value of the coefficient parameters from the population model. We know what the estimated values are, but can they help us get an idea of what the parameter values are?\n\n\n\n3. Math for minimizing SSE (aka OLS process)\nI am very sorry that this math was intimidating! Most of us don’t need to see the math, but there are a handful of students that should see it, and get a sense of the underlying math. Just wanted to make sure they saw it!\nThe important things for us to know is the information on the slide for Step 1 and 2, where we talk about the process itself. If I asked you why we minimize the SSE with respect to our coefficients, would you be able to answer?"

Is that suggesting a non linear relationship between two variables?\nHere is the plot that this question is referring to:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe answer is already in the question! The residual plot can also be used to look at linearity! The above plots that say “unbiased” mean they do not follow the linearity assumption.\n\n\n2. QQ Plot: What is it? And can you explain the axes, meaning of “quantiles”, and why assuming normality would result in a straight line?\nI cannot answer this question better than this video! They go through a smaller dataset of gene expression values and how to make a QQ plot from the data. Remember, our QQ plot is of our residual values!!\n\n\n3. I’m still a little confused on how to determine if a dataset has a normal distribution. Feels like a subjective decision.\nFirst thing that I want to address: when we are talking about normality, we are not determining if the dataset follows a normal distribution. We are determining if the fitted model violates the normality assumption that we need to use in our population model. We do this by seeing if the fitted residuals follow a normal distribution. I just want to draw attention to this. There is very particular language being used here.\nSecond thing… Yes! These diagnostic tools are somewhat subjective. You are welcome to use the Shapiro-Wilk test every time you look at a QQ plot! I realize a test with a conclusion might feel more objective and comfortable as we are learning about the model diagnostics. I suggest trying to make a conclusion visually with a QQ plot, then see if it matches the Shapiro-Wilk test. Remember, even in the Shapiro-Wilk test, the null hypothesis is that the fitted residuals come from a normal distribution. So we have to work to disprove that. You can come to the QQ plot with that same prior. If the QQ plot gives blantent evidence that the fitted residuals are not normally distributed, then we violate the assumption.\nWe’ll keep practicing! As we keep going through regression, we’ll realize that model building is very much an art! There is no one answer in statistics!\n\n\n4. What are the small nuances in interpreting the normality through a QQ plot?\nThanks for this question! This helped me realize that I was not articulating very well some of my more subconscious thoughts in a QQ plot.\nBelow are the distribution samples ant their QQ plots from lecture:\n\n\n\n\n\nI drew red, blue and green lines to bracket certain areas of the plots. I basically start by looking within the red brackets. Do all the points seem to stay close to the black line? If this doesn’t hold for the red bracketed area, then I would say our fitted residuals are not normal. Then I look at the area from the red lines to the blue lines. This is less definite, but if the points don’t seem to stay close to the black line, then I’d say our fitted residuals are not normal. Then I’d look at the are between the blue and green line. If the points aren’t close to the black line, then I am likely okay with it and would NOT make the conclusion that the fitted residuals are NOT normal. Notice, that I am not saying I call them normal. They seem to not violate the normal assumption.\nExtra note: The t-distribution is similar to a normal, but it includes larger tails. This is to adjust the normal distribution when our sample size of data is small. However, our assumption aims for fitted residuals to follow a normal distribution. We can be a little more flexible with the QQ plot when we have a smaller sample size, but we should not aim for a t-distribution. Both the normal and t-distribution samples “passed” my normality assessment.\nWe can check out the example:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, I would say that the fitted residuals violate the normal assumption. Notice that we have points off the black line between the red and blue lines. And even within the red lines, we have some curve. This is okay for our example! That’s because we have not yet included other (likely needed) variables in the model. And what does that mean? The other variables in the model will help explain MORE variance in our Y, which would alter the fitted residuals!!\nDraw the red, blue, and green lines on the other QQ plot slides. See what you find, especially when we have different sample sizes!\n\nStill compiling these muddy points:\n\n\nExplain formula for internally standardized residuals. 2. How do we determine WHAT the source of the issue is for an outlier… i.e. “outlier detection”. Is it just highly situational most times? 3. Leverage (h sub i) what is the significance of it? What does it “tell us” as values change?\n“cubic or square transformations must include original X, don’t do this for Y”\nThe transformations of the X and Y started to feel really abstract and kinda confusing\nthe relationship between what we’re learning about models and how we’ll actually apply that knowledge to a figure in a report, for example\nI understand the reasoning for transforming to make the data to fit the LINE assumptions, but if it makes it hard to interpret, why do we do it?\n\nHi and Hat metrics and not knowing the magnitude or reason for it was confusing.\nhttps://online.stat.psu.edu/stat501/lesson/11/11.2\n\n\nwhat are some other real life examples of influential points besides human error. Can they appear more organically\nI’m a little confused in the section about the power ladder – we’re supposed to be looking at the skew of the distribution of the residuals, but the examples shown were of different distributions (x alone, y alone, and x vs y). What should we be looking at to determine what transform, if any, to use?\nI’m not super clear on why transformations are even ok to do if they fundamentally change the shape of the data. You had a good sentence right at the end (second to last slide?) – “for every change in x, there’s a (…) change in longevity squared” or something like that? I think it’d be helpful to repeat or elaborate on that.\nI’m still not very clear on how to identify outliers vs high leveraged data points by looking at a plot alone.\n\n\nWhat is the reasoning behind why we usually want to transform the independent variable instead of the dependent?\nThis is more about interpretations in multiple linear models. We can have a model with multiple variables as covariates (so multiple X’s on the right side of the equation). If we transform Y, then all the interpretations with every covariate changes. If we can fit model assumptions better with a transformation to one X, then we only change one interpretation!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Tukey’s power ladder, is log(x) mean log10(x) or natural log(x)?\n\n\n\n\n\nExtra materials with examples of transformations\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIcqQhn3vSM&ab_channel=jbstatistics\nhttps://online.stat.psu.edu/stat501/lesson/9"

    "text": "Muddiest Points\n\n1. The lecture materials don’t always feel like they apply to the homework. If asked to “state the linear regression models,” are we just running lm()?\nStating the linear regression model is asking us to show the population model that we are fitting. This is just to make sure we are aware of the model that we plan to fit. So the generic form of this is: \\(Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X + \\epsilon\\).\nRunning lm() is the equivalent of fitting the model.\nKeep letting me know what feels disconnected in the class! Sometimes I purposefully say things in different ways to build our understanding, but sometimes that fails!\n\n\n2. “all of the different manifestations of t”\nI love the way this person said it!\nSo I’ve sorted this out:\n\nWe say \\(T\\) follows a t-distribution\n\n\\(T\\) is the general name for the variable (like \\(X\\) or \\(Y\\))\n\nWe calculate a given \\(t\\)-value and call that \\(t\\)\n\nWe also call this the test statistic\n\nThe critical value that corresponds to a specific confidence interval and \\(\\alpha\\) is labelled \\(t^*\\)\n\n\n\n3. What’s the difference between SD and variance?\nSD (standard deviation) is the square root of the variance. That’s why I sometimes write \\(\\sigma\\) (standard deviation) or \\(\\sigma^2\\) (variance) when I’m talking about the distribution of residuals.\n\\[\n\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\sigma^2}\n\\]\nVariance is usually easier to work with mathematically, but standard deviation is in the units that match a variable. For example, the variance of 10 height measurements are in square inches, but the standard deviation are in inches.\n\n\n4. Why is it important to test if \\(\\beta_1\\) is equal to zero? Is \\(\\beta_1=0\\) the same as the x and y variables having no correlation?\nLet’s answer the second question: Yes! It is the same in simple linear regression. When we get to multiple linear regression, and have several variables/coefficients in our model, testing \\(\\beta_1=0\\) won’t be the same as testing the correlation.\nIn simple linear regression, it is important to test \\(\\beta_1\\) mostly for pedagogical reasons. It’s just helpful to establish the process in a simpler setting.\n\n\n5. SSE and sigma\nWe were looking at the relationship between SSE and \\(\\widehat\\sigma^2\\):\n\\[ \\widehat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{1}{n-2}SSE \\]\nThe sum of square errors is \\(SSE = \\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \\widehat{Y}_i)^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\epsilon_i^2\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn aside on variance\n\n\n\nThe definition of variance is the sum of the squared differences between values and their mean.\nSo if I had a variable \\(S\\), with 100 observations, the mean of \\(S\\), which we call \\(\\overline{S}\\), would be \\(\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{100} S_i}{100}\\). The variance of \\(S\\) would be \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{100} (S_i - \\overline{S})^2\\).\n\n\nNow, let’s get back to the sum of square errors: \\(SSE = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\epsilon_i^2\\)\nThe variance of the residuals would be \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n (\\epsilon_i - \\overline{\\epsilon})^2\\). The mean of \\(\\epsilon\\), \\(\\overline\\epsilon\\), should be 0 by our assumptions. So the variance of the residuals is \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\epsilon_i^2\\) which is our SSE!\nThere is some more complicated math that goes into why our variance is divided by n-2 to get the estimated variance of the residuals, but that’s basically it!\n\n\n6. It would be helpful to get some clarification on the notations that we need to use in this class. Perhaps, a chart or the types of notations for this class could be helpful to organize this?\nI can certainly work on this! In all honesty, I am a little overwhelmed with work this week, so I don’t think this is something I can produce by the quiz. If you want to get one started, I can share it! I think would be a really good thing to help you study, too!\n\n\n7. What is the relationship between the ANOVA for linear regression and ANOVA for group differences?\n\n\n8. The limitations of the different tests, like an F statistic vs. t-test\n\n\n9. unexplained vs the explained\n\n\n10. Changing the confidence level in tidy()\nHere is a good site about the input! Looks like we would use conf.level to change 95% confidence interval to some other percent."

    "text": "Muddiest Points\n\n1. Why do we need to create a new variable for ordinal / scoring?\nOtherwise R will treat income as non-ordinal, and use the default reference cell coding. So if we want our variables to be scored (and numeric) then we must put it in a form R can recognize.\n\n\n2. I’m a little confused on how the R code works for recoding/reordering our variables, specifically 1) why we use the mutate function but then use the same name for the variable/how that works and 2) why you need to include the list of each variable name in a vector. Basically, what each piece of that code does exactly and why it’s needed.\n\nMutate is just a function to create/change a variable. So if we are not fundamentally changing any aspect of the variable, we can call it by the same name. Helps keep our data frame neat by not tacking on additional variables.\nWhen I am including the list of levels I am giving R the exact order to read each level. So if I want to go from high income to low income, I would reset the levels to the below code. Then R would read high income as the first level.\n\ngapm2 = gapm2 %&gt;%\n mutate(income_levels = factor(income_levels, \n            ordered = T, \n            levels = c(\"High income\", \n                       \"Upper middle income\", \n                       \"Lower middle income\", \n                       \"Low income\")))\n\n\n\n\n3. Is there a rationale or strategy in choosing the most appropriate reference group?\nOften no, not if the groups are not ordered. Things that you may consider:\n\nIs there a central group that you want to make comparisons to?\nIs there any social consequences of continually centering comparisons to one group? We may be consequentially centering the narrative around that group.\nWhen we interpret the coefficients, is there one group as the reference that makes it a little easier to interpret? (this has more of an effect in 513)\n\n\n\n4. How do we build the regression indicators?\nIn R, we don’t need to build the indicators. If we have a variable that is a facotr with mutually exclusive groups, then R will automatically create the indicators within the lm() function.\n\n\n5. Interpretations!\n\n5.1 Interpreting a confounder\nWe model a confounder by adding it into the model (without an interaction, just the main effect).\n\nThus, our interpretation follows the interpretations that were presented in Lesson 8: Intro to MLR\n\n\n\n5.2 Interpreting the main effects when there is an interaction\nComing soon!!\n\n\n5.3 Interpreting the interaction (effect modifier)\nFirst, we model an effect modifier with an interaction!\nComing soon!!\n\n\n\n6. Can we use continuous covariates in an interaction model?\nYes! Here are the four types of interactions we’ll discuss:\n\nbinary categorical and continuous\nmulti-level categorical and continuous\nbinary categorical and multi-level categorical\ncontinuous and continuous\n\n\n\n7. Synergerism vs. antagonism: how does \\(\\beta_3\\) relate to each?\n\nSynergerism means the sign of interaction’s coefficient (\\(\\beta_3\\)) matches that of main effect of \\(X_1\\), so the effect of \\(X_1\\) is strengthened as \\(X_2\\) increases\n\nIn the case that we’re looking at \\(X_2\\) as an effect modifier of \\(X_1\\)\nIt’s a little hard to think about this when we’ve only discussed \\(X_2\\) as a binary covariate, but our “increase” for an indicator is going from 0 to 1.\n\nAntagonism means the sign of interaction’s coefficient (\\(\\beta_3\\)) is flipped from that of main effect of \\(X_1\\), so the effect of \\(X_1\\) is weakened as \\(X_2\\) increases\n\nIn the case that we’re looking at \\(X_2\\) as an effect modifier of \\(X_1\\)\nIt’s a little hard to think about this when we’ve only discussed \\(X_2\\) as a binary covariate, but our “increase” for an indicator is going from 0 to 1\n\n\n\n\n8. The red and green lines example. I’m not totally sure why the lines would be parallel if an interaction affects the slope of a line?\nThe lines should not be parallel if there is an interaction. Let me show the equation for each of those examples:\n\nHere is the plot and equation when \\(X_2\\) is a confounder:\n\nHere is the plot and equation when \\(X_2\\) is an effect modifier:\n\nHere is the plot and equation when \\(X_2\\) is a effect modifier:\n\nHere is the plot and equation when \\(X_2\\) should not be in the model:"

    "text": "Muddiest Points\n\n1. Why is it not called multivariate?\nMultivariate models refer to models that have multiple outcomes. In multiple/multivariable models, we still only have one outcome, \\(Y\\), but multiple predictors.\n\n\n2. When adjusting for another variable, how do we calculate the new slope and intercept?\nFirst, I want to clarify one thing: in the case of two covariates, we only have the best fit plane. The intercept is really just a placeholder for when the covariates are 0. And the coefficients for each covariate are no longer stand alone slopes, unless we examine a specific instance when one covariate takes on a realized value. (Okay, that was kinda a lot of vague language. Let’s go to our example.)\nFor \\[\\widehat{\\text{LE}} = 33.595 + 0.157\\ \\text{FLR}\n+ 0.008\\ \\text{FS}\\], we have a regression plane.\nWhen we derive the regression lines for either variable, FLR or FS, we can think of the other variable as part of the intercept for the line:\nFor FLR: \\[\\widehat{\\text{LE}} = [33.595 + 0.008\\ \\text{FS}] + 0.157\\ \\text{FLR} \\] For FS: \\[\\widehat{\\text{LE}} = [33.595 + 0.157\\ \\text{FLR}]\n+ 0.008\\ \\text{FS}\\]\nFor FLR, any given FS value will result in the same slope, but the intercept will change. That’s why we say “holding FS constant,” “adjusting for FS,” or “controlling for FS” when we discuss the \\(\\widehat\\beta_1=0.157\\) estimate. Depending on the FS value, the intercept will change. So we can write: \\[(\\widehat{\\text{LE}}|FS=3000) = [33.595 + 0.008\\cdot 3000] + 0.157\\ \\text{FLR}= 57.595 + 0.157\\ \\text{FLR}\\]\nTry going through the same process for FS when FLR is 30%.\n\n\n3. I know we can’t really do visualizations past 3 coefficients but I still can’t really wrap my head around how this will work once we add a third covariate to the model.\nYeah… this is a tough one! You can try to think of the fitted Y \\(\\widehat{Y}|X\\) as being built from all the covariate values, and really just the equation for the best-fit line that we estimate. At three covariates, we need to let go of some of the visualizations.\n\n\n4. Still a little unsure about OLS\nI was going to write out an explanation to this, but then I wrote my explanation to the below question. I honestly think it helps bring context to OLS and talk about it in a new way that might help if it’s been confusing so far.\n\n\n5. We keep getting back to \\(\\widehat{Y}\\), \\(Y_i\\), and \\(\\overline{Y}\\) and their relationship to the population parameter estimates. Can you clarify this?\nI think it’ll be helpful to use the dataset I created from our quiz. I still think this relationship is best communicated with simple linear regression. What you didn’t see on the quiz was that I simulated the data:\n\nset.seed(444) # Set the seed so that every time I run this I get the same results\nx = runif(n=200, min = 40, max = 85) # I am sampling 200 points from a uniform distribution with minimum value 40 and maximum value 85\ny = rnorm(n=200, 215 - 0.85*x, 13) # Then I can construct my y-observations based on x. Notice that 215 is the true, underlying intercept and -0.85 is the true underlying slope\ndf = data.frame(Age = x, HR = y) # Then I combine these into a dataframe\n\nThen we can look at the scatterplot:\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n  geom_point(size = 1) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, linewidth = 1, colour=\"#F14124\") +\n  labs(x = \"Age (years)\", \n       y = \"Peak exercise heart rate (bpm)\",\n       title = \"Peak exercise heart rate vs. Age\") +\n    theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 11), \n        axis.text = element_text(size = 11), \n        title = element_text(size = 11))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach point represents an observation \\((X_i, Y_i)\\). That is where we get \\(Y_i\\) from\nThe red line represents \\(\\widehat{Y}\\). We can look at each \\(\\widehat{Y}|X\\), so we look at the expected \\(Y\\) at a specific age like 70 years old.\nNow we need to find \\(\\overline{Y}\\). This does not take \\(X\\) into account. So we can look at the observed \\(Y\\)’s and find the mean\n\nggplot(df, aes(HR)) + geom_histogram()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmean(df$HR)\n\n[1] 162.8725\n\n\n\nThen we can draw a line on the scatterplot for \\(\\overline{Y}\\):\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n  geom_point(size = 1) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, linewidth = 1, colour=\"#F14124\") +\n  labs(x = \"Age (years)\", \n       y = \"Peak exercise heart rate (bpm)\",\n       title = \"Peak exercise heart rate vs. Age\") +\n    theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 11), \n        axis.text = element_text(size = 11), \n        title = element_text(size = 11)) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = mean(df$HR), linewidth = 1, colour=\"green\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we talk about SSY (total variation), we can think of the histogram of the Y’s\n\nggplot(df, aes(HR)) + geom_histogram() + xlim(100, 225)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen the total variation of these observed values is related to the \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \\overline{Y})^2\\). Let’s plot \\(Y_i - \\overline{Y}\\):\n\ndf = df %&gt;% mutate(y_center = HR - mean(HR))\nggplot(df, aes(y_center)) + geom_histogram() + xlim(-60, 50)+ylim(0, 35)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, we can fit a regression line to show the relationship between Y and X. For every observation \\(X_i\\) there is a specific \\(\\widehat{Y}\\) from the regression line. So if we take the difference between the mean Y and the fitted Y, then we get the variation that is explained by the regression.\n\nmod1 = lm(HR ~ Age, data = df)\naug1 = augment(mod1)\ndf = df %&gt;% mutate(fitted_y = aug1$.fitted, \n                   diff_mean_fit = fitted_y - mean(HR))\nggplot(df, aes(diff_mean_fit)) + geom_histogram() + xlim(-60, 50)+ylim(0, 35)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the plot above, there is variation! And it means that some of the variation in the plot of Y alone is actually coming from this variation explained by the regression model!!\nBut there is left over variation that is not explained by the model… What is that? It’s related to our residuals: \\(\\widehat\\epsilon_i = Y_i - \\widehat{Y}_i\\)\nSo we’ll calculate the residuals (or more appropriately, use the calculation of the residuals that R gave us)\n\nmod1 = lm(HR ~ Age, data = df)\naug1 = augment(mod1)\ndf = df %&gt;% mutate(diff_y_fitted = aug1$.resid)\nggplot(df, aes(diff_y_fitted)) + geom_histogram() + xlim(-60, 50) +ylim(0, 35)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur aim in regression (through ordinary least squares) is to minimize the variance in the above plot. The more variance our model can explain, the less variance in the residuals. In SLR, we can only explain so much variance with a single predictor. As we include more predictors in our model, the model has the opportunity to explain even MORE variance.\n\n\n6. I feel that I am understanding and beginning to memorize the “processes” but failing to understand the “how/when/why” we apply certain models. Like, if you let me loose into the world tomorrow, I feel I would not be able to implement anything that I have learned thus far out in the wild.\nI feel you. Today was meant to establish the tools and the process for the hypothesis tests. In the next few classes we are going to shape the how/when/why. There’s so many that we can’t cover them in one class. So I thought it would be best to introduce the tools on their own, and then discuss how we use each one.\n\n\n7. I’m struggling with how to use the SSE, SSR, and SSY graphs but I think I just need to spend more time with them.\nWe’re going to keep talking about this! I think I have a good visual explanation that will help us connect some ideas!\n\n\n8. Using R to conduct each F-test\nI show this a little bit for the overall test, but let’s explicitly write it out for the example with the group of covariates.\nLet’s say our proposed model is:\n\\[\\text{LE} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{FLR} + \\beta_2 \\text{FS} + \\beta_3 WS + \\epsilon\\]\nAnd we want to see if it fits the data significantly better than:\n\\[LE = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 FLR + \\epsilon\\]\nWe need to fit both models first:\n\n# Reduced model\nmod_red3 = lm(LifeExpectancyYrs ~ FemaleLiteracyRate, data = gapm_sub2)\n\n# Full model\nmod_full3 = lm(LifeExpectancyYrs ~ FemaleLiteracyRate + FoodSupplykcPPD + WaterSourcePrct,\n               data = gapm_sub2)\n\nAnd then all we need to do is call each model into the anova() function! The order of the models in the function will not matter for the F-test.\n\nanova(mod_red3, mod_full3) %&gt;% tidy() %&gt;% gt() %&gt;% fmt_number(decimals = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      term\n      df.residual\n      rss\n      df\n      sumsq\n      statistic\n      p.value\n    \n  \n  \n    LifeExpectancyYrs ~ FemaleLiteracyRate\n70.00\n2,654.87\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n    LifeExpectancyYrs ~ FemaleLiteracyRate + FoodSupplykcPPD + WaterSourcePrct\n68.00\n1,517.92\n2.00\n1,136.96\n25.47\n0.00\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nAnd then we have all the information we need for our conclusion! Because the statistic is 25.47 and its corresponding p-value &lt; 0.001, we reject the null!\n\n\n9. Calculating the F-statistic\nWe will not need to know exactly how to calculate the F-statistic! We just need to understand the context of the calculation. With that poll everywhere question, I just wanted you to have a moment to interact with the fact the the F-test is measuring the difference in the sum of squares of the error.\n\n\n10. Why is SSE of the reduced model always greater than or equal to SSE of the full model?\nThe more variables that we have in the model, the more variation in our outcome we can explain. The worst case scenario is that the added variable does not help explain variation, then we are left with the same SSE as a model without the variable. If the variable add any information about our outcome, then we decrease the SSE.\n\n\n11. How many variables would be too many to include in MLR? What if they all help explain the regression?\nWhat a fun question! The maximum number of variables that you can have in a model is the number of observations that you have. At that point, you can have a variable that is an indicator of each observation. Basically, a singular mapping from each individual observation to its respective outcome.\nAnd this will explain the variation in Y perfectly!! But it won’t illuminate useful information. We cannot generalize it to the population. So with the number of variables that we include in the model, we need to balance generalizability and reduction of error."

Through that class he found his way to two different summer REU programs and eventually to a PhD in Applied Mathematics from Iowa State University (2018). While initially believing that he would stay in academia after his graduate work, being introduced to machine learning methods caused him to pursue data science jobs after graduation.\nDr. Dairyko served as a Senior Manager of Data Science at the Milwaukee Brewers and is now the Director of Ticketing Analytics at the Milwaukee Bucks. Helping the organization get the most out of budgeting, revenue, and ticket sales allows him to fully use his training in mathematics and data science.\n\n\n\nTopics covered\nDr. Dairyko’s graduate work is in graph theory, in particular, exponential domination. In a graph, exponential domination is the extent to which a particular vertex influences the remaining vertices in a graph. His published work falls very much within the realm of mathematics, proving that particular properties of graphs exist. However, graph theory is intimately related to machine learning; for example, it is the foundational structure of a neural network. Understanding properties of graphs help data scientists develop even more powerful models to harness information from data.\n\n\nRelevant work\n\nM.

    "text": "Statistician of the Week: Florence Nightingale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlorence Nightingale\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNightingale was a nurse who is considered to be the founder of modern nursing. In particular, she was admant about the importance of hygiene and sanitary conditions. She was born into a wealthy and well-connected family and had a large amount of privilege. Educated by her father, she showed an ability toward making analytic arguments at an early age. For her work, she was awarded the Royal Red Cross, the Lady of Grace of the Order of St John, and the Order of Merit.\n\n\n\nTopics covered\nNightingale was a nurse and statistician who used her analytic abilities to better understand and improve public health. She served in the Crimean War where Britain and France fought against the Russian invasion of the Ottoman Empire. Nightingale worked to convince Queen Victoria that poor sanitation and overcrowding were causing unnecessary death. She was able to show, for example, that peacetime soldiers (who lived in poorly kept barracks) were dying in much higher number than comparable civilian men. Her genius was to collect data meticulously and to display it in ways that were accessible to the general public. Her visualizations are lauded as pioneering and the first of their kind to tell effective stories of important issues.\n\n\nRelevant work\n\nRJ Andrews, “Florence Nightingale’s Data Revolution” in Scientific American 327, 2, 78-85, 2022. doi:10.1038/scientificamerican0822-78,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Diagram of the causes of mortality in the army in the East” was published in Notes on Matters Affecting the Health, Efficiency, and Hospital Administration of the British Army and sent to Queen Victoria in 1858.\n\n\n\n\n\nS Julious, “On the battlefields of the Crimean War and in the hills of Sheffield, Florence Nightingale’s legacy lives on”, The Tribune, Feb 17, 2023.\n\n\n\nOutside links\n\nWikipedia"

It is taught at the MS level.\n\n\nBoth theoretical and applied aspects of linear regression modeling will be covered in this course, including model building, model refinement, model diagnostics, hypothesis testing, parameter interpretation and scientific interpretation of results.\n\n\nStudents are expected to use R or SAS, when necessary, for homework assignments.\n\n\nTopics to be covered include simple linear regression, multiple regression, analysis of variance, residual and influence diagnostics, variable transformations, multicollinearity, model selection and validation.\n\n\n\n\nCourse Objectives:  The overall objective of this course is to help the student integrate and apply linear regression methods to scientific studies.\n\n\nThe student will learn to identify the scientific goals of a study\n\n\ndevelop a statistical strategy appropriate for those goals\n\n\nplan strategies for linear regression analysis and to implement these strategies\n\n\nbe aware of problems that arise in study design, power and data collection\n\n\ninterpret the results of linear regression analysis and convert them into a language understandable to the broad scientific community\n\n\n\n\nSchedule\n\n\nOnline class: M/W 1:00pm - 3:00pm Online lectures will be recorded No class on Sep 6 (Labor Day), Oct 18 (Fall Study Break)\n\n\nOffice hours (OH): Office hours will NOT be recorded Monday TBD (GSI) Wednesday 3:00pm - 5:00pm (instructor) Mousumi: please change to yours Note: if you are in a very different time zone, please email the instructor to schdule a separate OH when needed Exams and project Midterm I    (20%): Oct 6 (in class) Midterm II   (20%): Nov 22 (in class) Final project (30%): Group presentation on Dec 6 and 8 Final project (30%): Final report due on Dec 10\n\n\n\n\n Homework 30% Approximately weekly homework due on Mondays Suggestions: Begin working on homework questions shortly after they are assigned Attempt all homework questions alone (thoughtfully), before consulting others\n\n\nEthics: Collaborating on homework is OK, but homework turned in should reflect each student’s understanding Regrade policy: Please carefully review the homework/exam solution. To request a revised grade, please see the instructor or GSI during office hours. If no misgrading is found after examination of your case, your grade will be further lowered by the same amount (X points). A grade is considered “final” two weeks after it has been posted\n\n\n\n\nEmailing\n\n\nWe strongly encourage you to come to the office hour if you have technical questions such as how to approach a particular homework problem. Discussion on technical issues over email is inefficient.\n\n\nWhen emailing about this course, please put “BIOSTAT650” (no space) into the subject line\n\n\n\n\nOther suggestions Always try to think about “Why is this material important?” (if unclear, then ask) explain concepts/methods/results in layman language and/or in a graph\n\n\nHelp me, your classmates, and yourself learn better by Asking questions in class (raise your hand or type in the chat box) Turning your video on (not required but recommended)\n\n\nSpend time: 4 credit hour class means In class: 4 hours per week Outside of class: 8 to 12 hours per week (=2 to 3 hours for each credit)\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Linear Regression\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Linear Regression? Regression: a technique to study the association between two variables Response variable (outcome, dependent variable) Blood pressure Grouping variable (predictor, independent variable, explanatory variable) Male vs female – within each group, the value of the grouping variable is constant Drug dosage – continuous predictor of interest, infinitely many groups Adjustment for other variables\n\n\nLinear model: for our purposes, refers to linearity w.r.t. the parameters\n\n\nResponse variable is a linear function of parameters\n\n\nRegression models describe association, not causality\n\n\n\n\nWhy should I care? Most widely used and most developed method in statistics Appropriate in many practical settings Important to understand limitations Easy to interpret\n\n\nFun fact: one of the most frequently asked data scientist interview question What are the assumptions underlying linear regression?\n\n\n\n\nWhy should I care?\n\n\nMost importantly, it serves as a building block Essential concepts and ideas extend well to other regression methods and other areas e.g. you will see the following generic equation frequently: \\(\\sum_{i=1}^nX_i\\trans(Y_i-\\mu_i)=0\\) where \\(\\mu_i=X_i\\trans\\beta\\) in linear regression It says “the residuals are orthogonal to the covariates”\n\n\nTechniques used in linear regression apply to other regression methods e.g. estimation, hypothesis testing, model diagnosis\n\n\n\n\nLinear Regression: Objectives\n\n\nObjectives of any data analysis can generally be categorized as either inference or prediction\n\n\nrare that only one objective of interest in practice, both are usually of various degrees of importance\n\n\nInference:\n\n\nEstimation Hypothesis testing\n\n\n\n\nInference: Estimation \n\n\nIncludes both point and interval estimation\n\n\nSign of regression coefficient may be of interest; or, both sign and magnitude e.g., estimate mean change in serum cholesterol per unit increase in BMI model parameters must have clear interpretation (limits complexity of model)\n\n\n\n\nInference: Hypothesis Testing\n\n\nWe observe the data in the study sample; what can we infer about the underlying population of interest?\n\n\nHypothesis testing reduces results of study down to a sequence of yes/no answers\n\n\nModel parameters must be interpretable for inference to be meaningful\n\n\ne.g., on average, does serum cholesterol change as BMI (body mass index) increases? what about each of the following: age, gender, race, SBP (systolic blood pressure)?\n\n\n\n\nPrediction\n\n\nUsing regression model to predict response for yet unobserved subjects Accuracy and precision of predictions take precedence over interpretability of regression parameters\n\n\ne.g., develop a linear regression model to predict serum cholesterol given a set of patient characteristics (age, gender, race, BMI, SBP, etc)\n\n\n\n\n Data Analysis Process: Overview\n\n\nDescriptive analysis often skipped or done carelessly\n\n\nVERY important first step\n\n\nPropose model often done in close consultation with investigators\n\n\nEstimate model parameters\n\n\nAssess underlying assumptions of model → return to (1)?\n\n\nHypothesis testing and/or prediction\n\n\nInterpretation, conclusions\n\n\n\n\nWhat will be covered in BIOSTAT 650?\n\n\n\n\nSimple Linear Regression: one predictor SLR features one response variable and a single covariate\n\n\nModel: Yi = β0 + β1Xi + ϵi\n\n\nYi: response β0, β1: parameters Xi: covariate ϵi: error\n\n\n“Simple”: one covariate only\n\n\nRather restrictive since only one covariate is involved\n\n\noften, interest lies in several covariates if only interested in one certain covariate, may need to adjust for other covariates\n\n\n\n\nMultiple Linear Regression: multiple predictors\n\n\nMultiple Regression: q(&gt;1) covariates Model Yi = β0 + β1Xi1 + β2Xi2 + … + βqXiq + ϵi\n\n\n\n\n0.01\n\n\n\n0.75\n\n\nFor compactness, often use matrix notation Compared to simple linear regression βj’s have much different interpretation\n\n\nMuch more complicated than SLR; Much greater chance to mis-model the data set\n\n\n\n0.25 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nResidual Diagnostics  Most of the assumptions underlying linear regression model are about the error term: \\[\\begin{split}\n            \\epsilon_i &amp; \\sim  N(0,\\sigma^2)  \\\\\n            \\epsilon_i &amp; \\ind \\epsilon_j,\\; \\forall i, \\;j,\\; i\\neq\nj\n        \\end{split}\\] Failure of any of these assumptions to hold could invalidate various aspects of the analysis\n\n\nResiduals = estimated errors: ϵ̂i\n\n\nResidual diagnostics aims to check validity of error assumptions after model fitting\n\n\nresults of residual diagnostics could imply that modifications to model are required\n\n\n\n\nTransformations of the outcome Consider the following SLR model: Yi = β0 + β1Xi + ϵi It is possible that, instead, some function of Yi, say h(Yi), should be modeled: h(Yi) = β0 + β1Xi + ϵi Possible choices for h(⋅): $$\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n            h(Y_i) &amp; = &amp; \\log(Y_i) \\nonumber \\\\\n            h(Y_i) &amp; = &amp; \\log_{10}(Y_i) \\nonumber \\\\\n            h(Y_i) &amp; = &amp; \\sqrt{Y_i} \\nonumber \\\\\n            h(Y_i) &amp; = &amp; 1/Y_i \\nonumber\n            \n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\\[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"frame\"&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Transformations of the covariate(s)&lt;/span&gt; Consider the\nfollowing SLR model: &lt;span class=\"math display\"&gt;\\]\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n        Y_i &amp; = &amp; \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_{i} +  \\beta_2 X^2_{i} +\n\\epsilon_i \\nonumber\n        \n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\\[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is still a linear model! “Linear\" refers to being linear in the\ncoefficients Transformation of the covariate can include &lt;span\nclass=\"math display\"&gt;\\]\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n            &amp;   &amp;  \\log(X_i) \\nonumber \\\\\n            &amp;   &amp;X^2_{i}, \\cdots, X^q_{i}   \\nonumber \\\\\n            &amp;   &amp;\\sqrt{X_i} \\nonumber \\\\\n            &amp;   &amp; \\mbox{splines:} ~~~ (X_i-a)_+\\nonumber\n            \n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\\[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"frame\"&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Transformations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Need to be very careful when using transformations&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;interpretation of parameters changes completely transforming the\noutcome alters assumptions regarding error structure&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"frame\"&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Outliers/Influence Diagnostics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Consider the fitted model: &lt;span\nclass=\"math display\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ŷ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;em&gt;β̂&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + &lt;em&gt;β̂&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What impact does &lt;span\nclass=\"math inline\"&gt;(&lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\nhave on &lt;span\nclass=\"math inline\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ŷ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;?

Regression: a technique to study the association between two variables Response variable (outcome, dependent variable) Blood pressure Grouping variable (predictor, independent variable, explanatory variable) Male vs female – within each group, the value of the grouping variable is constant Drug dosage – continuous predictor of interest, infinitely many groups Adjustment for other variables\nLinear model: for our purposes, refers to linearity w.r.t. the parameters\nResponse variable is a linear function of parameters\nRegression models describe association, not causality\n\n\nWhy should I care? Most widely used and most developed method in statistics Appropriate in many practical settings Important to understand limitations Easy to interpret\nFun fact: one of the most frequently asked data scientist interview question What are the assumptions underlying linear regression?\n\n\nWhy should I care?\nMost importantly, it serves as a building block Essential concepts and ideas extend well to other regression methods and other areas e.g. you will see the following generic equation frequently:\n\\(\\sum_{i=1}^nX_i\\trans(Y_i-\\mu_i)=0\\) where \\(\\mu_i=X_i\\trans\\beta\\) in linear regression\nIt says “the residuals are orthogonal to the covariates\"\nTechniques used in linear regression apply to other regression methods e.g. estimation, hypothesis testing, model diagnosis\n\n\nLinear Regression: Objectives\nObjectives of any data analysis can generally be categorized as either inference or prediction\nrare that only one objective of interest in practice, both are usually of various degrees of importance\nInference:\nEstimation Hypothesis testing\n\n\nInference: Estimation\nIncludes both point and interval estimation\nSign of regression coefficient may be of interest; or, both sign and magnitude e.g., estimate mean change in serum cholesterol per unit increase in BMI model parameters must have clear interpretation (limits complexity of model)\n\n\nInference: Hypothesis Testing\nWe observe the data in the study sample; what can we infer about the underlying population of interest?\nHypothesis testing reduces results of study down to a sequence of yes/no answers\nModel parameters must be interpretable for inference to be meaningful\ne.g., on average, does serum cholesterol change as BMI (body mass index) increases?

We could consider the following two alternatives: We could fit a model using all of the covariates. In this case, \\(\\widehat{\\beta}\\) is unbiased for \\({\\beta}\\), but it has very high variance. We could fit a model using the five strongest predictors. In this case, \\(\\widehat{\\beta}\\) will be biased for \\({\\beta}\\), but it will have lower variance. For prediction, either approach 1 or approach 2 could perform better, depending on the circumstances\n\n\nTraining vs Test error\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\nModel Selection for Prediction: Big Picture\n\\(\\bullet~~\\)Model selection methods generally consist of the same essential steps:\nSpecify maximum/full model construct a list of all candidate covariates Specify criterion for comparing competing models how well the model fits current data (training error) how well the model predicts future responses (test error) Select best (sequence of) model(s) where “best\" is defined by (2) All-Possible-subsets Regression (APR) forward, backward, hybrid Test error estimation and model validation Accuracy of the predictions when we apply our model to previously unseen test data not used to train the model indirectly estimate test error: criteria in (2) directly estimate test error: cross-validation\n\n\nStep 1: Specifying Maximum Model Maximum model: all covariates which are candidates for inclusion in final model\nNecessary to inspect data carefully before choosing candidate covariates: covariates must be scored on a meaningful scale covariates must have sufficient variability no covariate should be highly predicted by remaining covariates (i.e., beware of potential high \\(VIF_j=1/(1-R^2_j)\\) ahead of time)\n“Size” of maximum model (\\(p\\)) can be constrained by sample size (e.g., \\(\\geq\\)5 subjects per parameter)\nStatisticians and investigators should work closely together in constructing maximum model\n\n\nStep 3: Select Model Given a Criterion\nWe will introduce the approaches taking \\(p\\)-value as a criterion Selection by \\(p\\)-value is a commonly used and traditional method We will introduce other criteria (Step 2) in detail later\nAll-Possible-subsets Regression (APR) having chosen criterion for comparing models, fit models using all possible combinations of covariates final model is the one judged to be the best based on the specified criterion\nThere are many (\\(2^p-1\\)) possible combinations of covariates we want to avoid fitting and comparing all possible models desirable to apply computationally efficient selection methods\n\n\nStep 3: Classical Automated Selection Three “classical\" variations on theme: Forward Selection: start with null model (\\(\\beta_0\\) only); add covariates one at a time\nBackward Elimination: start with full model; delete covariates one at a time\nStepwise Regression (hybrid): combination of forward selection and backward elimination\nOther methods (not covered in 650), e.g., the LASSO\n\n\nAlgorithm 1: Forward Selection Pre-specify p-value threshold for inclusion: \\(p_{\\scriptscriptstyle\\text{$I$}}\\) (e.g., 0.05)\nBegin with null model (\\(\\beta_0\\) only) \\(\\mathcal{M}_0\\)\nAt each step, add the most significant covariate, provided \\(p&lt;p_{\\scriptscriptstyle\\text{$I$}}\\) for \\(k\\!=\\!0,\\dots,p\\!-\\!1\\), fit \\(p\\!-\\!k\\) models that add 1 predictor to \\(\\mathcal{M}_k\\) e.g., in the first step, \\(k=0\\), fit \\(p\\) SLRs covariate with lowest \\(p\\)-value (\\(p&lt;p_{\\scriptscriptstyle\\text{$I$}}\\)) gets entered into model \\(\\mathcal{M}_{k\\!+\\!1}\\)\nProcedure terminates when no more covariate meets the \\(p_{\\scriptscriptstyle\\text{$I$}}\\)-rule (\\(p&lt;p_{\\scriptscriptstyle\\text{$I$}}\\)) or all covariates have been added\n\n\nAlgorithm 2: Backward Elimination Pre-specify p-value for omitting: \\(p_{\\scriptscriptstyle\\text{$O$}}\\) (e.g., 0.05)\nBegin with maximum model \\(\\mathcal{M}_p\\)\nAt each step, eliminate least significant covariate, provided \\(p\\!&gt;\\!p_{\\scriptscriptstyle\\text{$O$}}\\) for \\(k\\!=\\!p,\\dots,1\\), fit \\(k\\) models that remove 1 predictor from \\(\\mathcal{M}_k\\) e.g., in the first step, \\(k=p\\), fit \\(p\\) models each w/ \\(p-1\\) predictors covariate with highest \\(p\\)-value (\\(p\\!&gt;\\!p_{\\scriptscriptstyle\\text{$O$}}\\)) gets removed to obtain \\(\\mathcal{M}_{k\\!-\\!1}\\)\nProcedure terminates when no more covariate meets the \\(p_{\\scriptscriptstyle\\text{$O$}}\\)-rule (\\(p&gt;p_{\\scriptscriptstyle\\text{$O$}}\\)), i.e., all covariates are significant in the sense that \\(p&lt;p_{\\scriptscriptstyle\\text{$O$}}\\)\n\n\nAlgorithm 3: Stepwise Regression Pre-specify \\(p_{\\scriptscriptstyle\\text{$I$}}\\) and \\(p_{\\scriptscriptstyle\\text{$O$}}\\) satisfying \\(p_O\\geq p_I\\)\nBegin with null model (\\(\\beta_0\\) only)\nProceed as in forward selection.

\\underbrace{\\sigma^2 \\boldT \\xtx^{-1} \\boldT^T}_\\text{denoted as $\\boldSigma$} \\;\\}\\) Under the null, \\(\\boldZ^\\top \\boldSigma^{-1} \\boldZ\\) should be small\n\n\nExample 1 Suppose the investigators want to examine whether the two lowest and two highest age intervals could be combined HR_i & = & _0 + _1AG_1i + _2AG_2i +_3AG_3i + _4AG_4i + _i\nthe pertinent hypotheses can be listed as: \\(H_0: \\beta_1=\\beta_2\\), \\(\\beta_4=0\\) \\(H_1: \\beta_1 \\neq \\beta_2\\), or \\(\\beta_4 \\neq 0\\) re-casting \\(H_0\\) in terms of the GLH, _ & = &\n\\(H_0: {\\boldT_{\\!\\sf\\scriptscriptstyle{2\\times 5}}}\\boldbeta_{\\!\\sf\\scriptscriptstyle{5\\times1}}={\\boldzero }_2\\) vs. \\(H_1: {\\boldT}\\boldbeta\\neq {\\boldzero }_2\\) test statistic: F = ^2 F_2,n-5\n\n\nExample 2 \\(n=26\\) subjects selected to participate in a study designed to examine the effects of weight and activity level on cholesterol levels (HDL)\nSubjects were placed into one of three groups: Group 1: control (n=8) Group 2: running (n=8) Group 3: running and weight training (n=10) Response: HDL (mg/dl) Covariates: group, weight (lbs) Does the association between weight and HDL differ by group?\n\n\nExample 2, Stratified SLR models It is common in practice to fit “stratified” models: Group 1: \\(HDL_i, = \\beta_1 + \\beta_4 W_i + \\epsilon_i\\) Group 2: \\(HDL_i = \\beta_2 + \\beta_5W_i + \\epsilon_i\\) Group 3: \\(HDL_i = \\beta_3 + \\beta_6W_i + \\epsilon_i\\) Models are fitted separately to “three datasets\" (each group is treated as a separate dataset).\nSince there are three distinct regression lines, we have distinct slopes\ndistinct intercepts\n\n\nExample 2 (From 3 SLR to 1 MLR) separate SLR models can be fitted on three datasets\nUltimately we wish to see if the set of models can be simplified, i.e., are the 3 slopes the same? if the slopes are the same, are the intercepts also the same? Fitting models separately does not readily allow us to test differences in parameters\nWe can represent the previous set of group-specific models in a single, more compact MLR model: \\({\\boldY } = {\\boldX}\\boldbeta + {\\boldepsilon}\\) where \\(\\boldbeta^T=(\\beta_1,\\ldots,\\beta_6)\\). What should \\({\\boldX}\\) be?\n\n\nExample 2: From Group-specific SLRs to MLR Group 1: \\({\\boldY }_1 = {\\boldX}_1\\boldbeta_1 + {\\boldepsilon}_1\\) = +\nGroup 2: \\({\\boldY }_2 = {\\boldX}_2\\boldbeta_2 + {\\boldepsilon}_2\\) = +\nGroup 3: \\({\\boldY }_3 = {\\boldX}_3\\boldbeta_3 + {\\boldepsilon}_3\\) = +\n\n\nExample 2: From Group-specific SLRs to MLR Group 1: \\({\\boldY }_1 = {\\boldX}_1\\boldbeta_1 + {\\boldepsilon}_1\\) = +\nGroup 2: \\({\\boldY }_2 = {\\boldX}_2\\boldbeta_2 + {\\boldepsilon}_2\\) = +\nGroup 3: \\({\\boldY }_3 = {\\boldX}_3\\boldbeta_3 + {\\boldepsilon}_3\\) = +\n\n\nExample 2 (MLR model) Using the typical MLR \\({\\boldY } = {\\boldX}\\boldbeta + {\\bf \\epsilon}\\), where = = =\n= \\(HDL=\\beta_1G_{1}+\\beta_2G_{2}+\\beta_3G_{3}+\\beta_4G_{1}W+\\beta_5G_{2}W+\\beta_6G_{3}W+\\epsilon\\), where \\(G_j=I(\\text{group } j),j=1,\\dots,3\\) and \\(W=(W_1,\\dots,W_{26})\\) Note: the above \\(\\boldX\\) spans, but does not contain, an intercept\n\n\nExample 2: parallelism \\(HDL=\\underbrace{\\left(\\beta_1G_{1}+\\beta_2G_{2}+\\beta_3G_{3}\\right)}_\\text{intercept}+\\underbrace{\\left(\\beta_4G_{1}+\\beta_5G_{2}+\\beta_6G_{3}\\right)}_\\text{slope}W+\\epsilon\\) Using the GLH approach, we can test whether the slopes of the group-specific regression lines are equal \\(H_0: \\beta_4=\\beta_5=\\beta_6\\) (lines are parallel),\n\\(H_1:\\) at least one of \\(\\beta_j\\), \\(j=4,5,6\\), is different from the others\n(at least one line is not parallel to the others) : \\(H_0: \\beta_4-\\beta_5=0\\) and \\(\\beta_5-\\beta_6=0\\),\nEquivalently: \\(H_1:\\beta_4 - \\beta_5 \\neq 0\\) or \\(\\beta_5 - \\beta_6 \\neq 0\\) Note: third contrast is redundant Re-framing \\(H_0\\) in terms of the GLH, = \\(H_0: {\\boldT}\\boldbeta={\\boldzero }_2\\) vs. \\(H_1: {\\boldT}\\boldbeta\\neq {\\boldzero }_2\\)\n\n\nExample 2: parallelism Test statistic: F = & & F_2,20 see R code and output: \\(F=2.95\\) \\(p=P(F_{2,20}&gt;2.95)=0.075\\)\nThis data is consistent with the parallelism hypothesis (null).\nWe have insufficient evidence to conclude the associations between weight and HDL differ across exercise groups (p=0.075).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Exercise: equality of intercepts\n\\(HDL=\\underbrace{\\left(\\beta_1G_{1}+\\beta_2G_{2}+\\beta_3G_{3}\\right)}_\\text{intercept}+\\underbrace{\\left(\\beta_4G_{1}+\\beta_5G_{2}+\\beta_6G_{3}\\right)}_\\text{slope}W+\\epsilon\\) We can also test the equality of intercepts of the group-specific regression lines \\(H_0: \\beta_1=\\beta_2=\\beta_3\\) Re-write hypotheses find \\({\\boldT}\\) in GLH \\(H_0: {\\boldT}\\boldbeta= {\\boldzero }_2\\) vs. \\(H_1: {\\boldT}\\boldbeta\\neq {\\boldzero }_2\\) =\nTest statistic:\n\\(F=~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\stackrel{H_0}{\\sim} F_{2,20}\\) \\(p=P(F_{2,20}&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~)=\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Exercise Answer Key: equality of intercepts\n\\(HDL=\\underbrace{\\left(\\beta_1G_{1}+\\beta_2G_{2}+\\beta_3G_{3}\\right)}_\\text{intercept}+\\underbrace{\\left(\\beta_4G_{1}+\\beta_5G_{2}+\\beta_6G_{3}\\right)}_\\text{slope}W+\\epsilon\\) We can also test the equality of intercepts of the group-specific regression lines \\(H_0: \\beta_1=\\beta_2=\\beta_3\\) Re-write hypotheses \\(H_0: \\beta_1-\\beta_2=0, \\beta_2-\\beta_3=0\\)\n(many different ways, e.g.,) \\(H_0: \\beta_3-\\beta_1=0, \\beta_2-\\beta_1=0\\) find \\({\\boldT}\\) in GLH \\(H_0: {\\boldT}\\boldbeta= {\\boldzero }_2\\) vs. \\(H_1: {\\boldT}\\boldbeta\\neq {\\boldzero }_2\\) =\nTest statistic:\n\\(F=~~~3.12~~~~\\stackrel{H_0}{\\sim} F_{2,20}\\) \\(p=P(F_{2,20}&gt;~~~3.12~~~~)=0.066\\)\n\n\nExample 2: Connection to reference cell coding and SS \\(\\boxed{HDL=\\underbrace{\\left(\\beta_1G_{1}+\\beta_2G_{2}+\\beta_3G_{3}\\right)}_\\text{intercept}+\\underbrace{\\left(\\beta_4G_{1}+\\beta_5G_{2}+\\beta_6G_{3}\\right)}_\\text{slope}W+\\epsilon}\\) Cell means coding: \\(H_0: \\underbrace{\\beta_5-\\beta_4}_\\text{2 vs 1}=0;

(^T)^-1^T\n& = &\n\n\nResiduals: Properties (continued) Var() & = & Var({-} )\n& = & (-) ^2 (-)^T\n& = & ^2(-)^2\n& = & ^2(-) Therefore, \\(\\widehat{\\boldepsilon}\\sim N({\\boldzero},\\sigma^2\\{{\\boldI}-{\\boldH}\\})\\), since \\(\\widehat{\\boldepsilon}\\) is a linear combination of Normals\n\n\nResiduals: Properties (cont’d) Therefore, if \\(\\boldepsilon \\sim\\) Normal, then \\(\\widehat{\\boldepsilon}\\sim\\) Normal if \\(E[{\\boldepsilon}]={\\boldzero}\\), then \\(E[\\widehat{\\boldepsilon}]={\\boldzero}\\) even if \\(\\{\\epsilon_1,\\ldots,\\epsilon_n\\}\\) are mutually independent,\n\\(\\{\\widehat{\\epsilon}_1,\\ldots,\\widehat{\\epsilon}_n\\}\\) are not independent cov\\((\\widehat{\\epsilon}_i,\\widehat{\\epsilon}_j)=-h_{ij}\\sigma^2\\) because \\(Var(\\widehat{\\boldepsilon})=\\sigma^2({\\boldI}-{\\boldH})\\) even if \\(Var(\\epsilon_i)=\\sigma^2\\) for all \\(i\\), \\(Var(\\widehat{\\epsilon}_i)\\neq \\sigma^2\\) for any \\(i\\) in fact \\(Var(\\widehat{\\epsilon}_i)=(1-h_{ii})\\sigma^2\\leq\\sigma^2\\) (\\(h_{ii}\\geq0\\) since \\(\\boldH\\) is positive definite)\n\n\nStandardized Residuals Standardized residuals (imperfect): _i & = & Rationale: \\(\\widehat{\\epsilon}_i\\)’s are unit-dependent (e.g., changing units of \\(Y_i\\) will change \\(\\widehat{\\epsilon}_i\\))\nStandardizing with \\(\\widehat{\\sigma}\\) is very easy to do.\nPatterns in \\(\\widehat{z}_i\\)’s will be the same as \\(\\widehat{\\epsilon}_i\\)’s, but easier to judge the magnitude of \\(\\widehat{\\epsilon}_i\\) because it is “standardized”\nMore meaningful to judge the magnitude of \\(\\widehat{\\epsilon}_i\\) relative to its standard deviation\n\n\nStandardized Residuals (continued)\n\\(\\widehat{z}_i\\)’s have mean \\(\\approx 0\\) and variance \\(\\approx 1\\)\nIf model assumptions are correct, \\(\\widehat{z}_i\\stackrel{\\cdot}{\\sim} N(0,1)\\).\nTherefore \\(\\widehat{z}_i\\)’s are more readily interpreted: P(|_i| ) & & 0.67\nP(|_i| ) & & 0.95\nP(|_i| ) & & 0.99 Advantage of \\(\\widehat{z}\\) over \\(\\widehat{\\epsilon}\\) is that we have a “rule of thumb\" to identify large value: \\(|\\widehat{z}_i| \\geq 2.5\\)\nHistogram, Q-Q (quantile-to-quantile) plot, box/whisker plot will have same pattern as for \\(\\widehat{\\epsilon}_i\\)’s (to be introduced soon)\n\n\nInternally Studentized Residuals Recall: \\(\\widehat{\\sigma}^2(1-h_{ii})\\), not \\(\\widehat{\\sigma}^2\\), is an unbiased estimator of \\(Var(\\widehat{\\epsilon}_i)\\) Internally studentized residuals: _i & = & where \\(h_{ii}=\\text{diag}(\\boldH)_i=\\) leverage for \\(i\\)’th individual (the \\(i\\)-th element of the diagonal of the hat matrix)\n\\(h_{ii}=\\boldX_i^T (\\boldX^T\\boldX)^{-1} \\boldX_i\\); Special case: in SLR h_ii & = & +\nReflects outlyingness in \\(\\boldX\\) space\n\\(E[\\widehat{r}_i]= 0\\), \\(Var(\\widehat{r}_i)\\approx 1\\), \\(\\widehat{r}_i\\sim t_{df SSE}\\). Note: when \\(df SSE\\) (or sample size) is large: \\(t_{df SSE}\\approx N(0,1)\\), \\(|t_{df SSE, 0.025}|\\approx 2\\)\n\n\nExternally Studentized Residuals\nExternally studentized residuals: _(-i) & = & \\(\\widehat{\\sigma}_{(-i)}\\) is an estimator of \\(\\sigma^2\\), with \\(i\\)’th individual deleted\nRationale:\nif \\(|\\widehat{\\epsilon}_i|\\) is large, \\(\\widehat{\\sigma}^2\\) may over-estimate \\(\\sigma^2\\) \\(\\widehat{\\epsilon}_i\\) can serve to mask its own outlyingness by inflating \\(\\widehat{\\sigma}^2\\) hence remove influence of \\(\\widehat{\\epsilon}_i\\) on \\(\\widehat{\\sigma}^2\\) by removing the data point\n\\(E[\\widehat{r}_{(-i)}]= 0\\), \\(Var(\\widehat{r}_{(-i)})\\approx 1\\), \\(\\widehat{r}_{(-i)}\\sim t_{dfSSE-1}\\)\nMost sensitive residuals for detecting outliers\nAlso known as “leave-one-out/Jackknife” residuals\n\n\nComparing Residual Types\nFor large samples, \\(\\widehat{\\epsilon}_i\\), \\(\\widehat{z}_i\\), \\(\\widehat{r}_i\\), \\(\\widehat{r}_{(-i)}\\) tend to provide similar information\nFor large samples, \\(\\widehat{r}_{(-i)}\\), \\(\\widehat{r}_i\\), \\(\\widehat{z}_i\\) follow, approximately, a standard normal distribution For small to moderate samples, a rank, in decreasing order of sensitivity: \\(\\widehat{r}_{(-i)}\\) \\(\\widehat{r}_i\\) \\(\\widehat{z}_i\\) \\(\\widehat{\\epsilon}_i\\)\n\n\nChecking functional form of continuous predictor (linearity)\n\n\nFunctional form of continuous predictor Continuous covariates may have nonlinear functional form of relationship with the outcome e.g. SBP vs age Several approaches to check Approach 1: Partial regression plots Approach 2: Categorizing predictor Approach 3: Testing and smoothing approaches (future lecture)\n\n\nResidual vs. covariate plots in SLR and MLR\nIn MLR: conditional association; in SLR, marginal=conditional. In simple linear regression, can plot \\(\\widehat{\\epsilon}\\) versus \\(X\\) (or \\(\\widehat{Y}\\)) to assess linearity of \\((X,Y)\\) relationship can detect departures from linearity, and nature of non-linear relationships If the current functional form has captured the effect of \\(X\\), then \\(\\widehat{\\epsilon}_i\\)’s should be randomly scattered and show no trend with \\(X\\) For multiple linear regression, situation is more complicated Plot of \\(\\widehat{\\epsilon}\\) versus \\(X_k\\) can be impacted other covariates\" If \\(X_k\\) is correlated with \\(X_j\\), and \\(X_j\\) has a non-linear association with \\(Y\\), then plot of \\(\\widehat{\\boldepsilon}\\) vs \\(X_k\\) will partially reflect non-linear association of \\(Y\\) and \\(X_j\\). Solution: Partial regression plots\n\n\nApproach 1: Partial Regression Plots Design matrix \\(\\boldX=[{\\boldone}_n, X_1,\\ldots, X_p]\\) \\(\\boldX_{-k}\\) contains all covariates, except \\(X_{k}\\)\nRegress \\({\\boldY}\\) on \\(\\boldX_{-k}\\) and get residual \\(\\widehat{\\boldepsilon}({\\boldY}|\\boldX_{-k})\\) \\(\\boldY=\\boldX_{-k}\\alpha%_{\\scriptscriptstyle {\\boldY}|\\boldX_{-k} }  +\\epsilon({\\boldY}|\\boldX_{-k})\\) Regress \\(X_{k}\\) on \\(\\boldX_{-k}\\) and get residual \\(\\widehat{\\boldepsilon}(\\boldX_{k}|\\boldX_{-k})\\) \\(X_{k}=\\boldX_{-k}  \\boldbeta%_{\\scriptscriptstyle\\boldX_{k}|\\boldX_{-k}}  +\\epsilon(\\boldX_{k} |\\boldX_{-k})\\) Plot \\(\\widehat{\\boldepsilon}(X_{k}|\\boldX_{-k})\\) vs. \\(\\widehat{\\boldepsilon}({\\boldY}|\\boldX_{-k})\\) both sets of residuals are covariate-adjusted (and hence model dependent): remove information/contribution from \\(\\boldX_{-k}\\) if linear, then shows the adjusted effect of \\(X_k\\); if nonlinear, then suggests a functional form of \\(X_k\\) (see also partial residual plot) can also help to spot outliers (extreme residuals in the Y direction) and “leverage points” (extreme residuals in the X direction)\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\nPartial Regression Plots–Example Example: Suppose we want to study association between Sytolic blood pressure (SBP) and covariates Age (\\(A_{i}\\)), Quetlet intex (\\(Q_i\\)), and smoking \\(S_{i}\\). \\(SBP_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_A A_i + \\beta_Q Q_i + \\beta_S S_i + \\epsilon_i\\)\nWe want to assess functional relationship between \\(SBP\\) and \\(Age\\) Fit first model: \\(SBP_i = \\gamma_0 + \\gamma_1 Q_{i} + \\gamma_3 S_i +\\epsilon_{i(SBP|Q,S)}\\)\nobtain residuals, \\(\\widehat{\\epsilon}_{i(SBP|Q,S)}\\)’s Fit second model: \\(A_{i} = \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 Q_{i} + \\alpha_2 S_i +\\epsilon_{i(Age|Q,S)}\\) obtain residuals \\(\\widehat{\\epsilon}_{i(A|Q,S)}\\)’s Plot \\(\\widehat{\\epsilon}_{i(SBP|Q,S)}\\) vs. \\(\\widehat{\\epsilon}_{i(Age|Q,S)}\\) pattern in plot describes association between \\(Age\\) and \\(SBP\\), adjusting for \\(Q\\) and \\(S\\)\n\n\nApproach 2: Categorize Continuous Predictor\nReplace continuous with categorical covariates, then examine pattern in coefficients of indicator variables Functional form of indicator variables can’t be misspecified e.g., blood pressure data: \\(SBP_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_A A_i + \\beta_Q Q_i + \\beta_S S_i + \\epsilon_i\\) We want to assess functional relationship between \\(SBP\\) and \\(Age\\) Eliminate the linearity assumption by treating age as categorical: Break age into groups containing (approximately) equal numbers of subjects and set up indicator covariates: AG_1i & = & I(41 A_i &lt; 48)\nAG_2i & = & I(48 A_i &lt; 54)\nAG_3i & = & I(54 A_i &lt; 59)\nAG_4i & = & I(59 A_i)\n\n\nCategorizing approach, continued (1) Revised model: E[SBP_i] & = & _0 + _A2AG_2i + _A3AG_3i +_A4AG_4i + _Q Q_i + _S S_i Now, plot \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_{A1}\\), \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_{A2}\\) \\(\\dots\\), \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_{A4}\\) against group-specific medians set \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_{A1}\\equiv0\\); \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_{A1}\\) \\(\\dots\\), \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_{A4}\\) are adjusted group mean differences Plot reflects true nature of association between \\(A_i\\) and \\(E[SBP_i]\\) linear? quadratic? U-shaped? threshold? If plot approximately linear: evidence in favor of linearity assumption\n\n\nViolation of Linearity Assumption If linearity fails \\(\\ldots\\) \\(\\widehat{\\boldbeta}\\): \\(\\widehat{\\boldY}\\): \\(\\widehat{\\sigma}^2\\): \\(\\widehat{Var}(\\widehat{\\boldbeta})\\): confidence intervals: hypothesis tests:\nPossible solutions: modify the model \\(\\ldots\\) additional covariates transform \\({\\boldY}\\); e.g., \\(log({\\boldY})\\), \\(\\sqrt{{\\boldY}}\\) transform certain \\(\\boldX_k\\)’s\n\n\nViolation of Linearity Assumption If linearity fails \\(\\ldots\\) \\(\\widehat{\\boldbeta}\\): biased \\(\\widehat{\\boldY}\\): biased \\(\\widehat{\\sigma}^2\\): biased \\(\\widehat{Var}(\\widehat{\\boldbeta})\\): biased confidence intervals: invalid hypothesis tests: wrong inference\nPossible solutions: modify the model additional covariates transform certain \\(\\boldX_k\\)’s based on the plots transform \\({\\boldY}\\); e.g., \\(log({\\boldY})\\), \\(\\sqrt{{\\boldY}}\\)\n\n\nIndependence Assumption\n\n\nIndependence Assumption Independence: (multivariate normal + ) \\(E[\\epsilon_i \\epsilon_j]=0\\) for \\(i\\neq j\\)\nimplies: \\(Y_i\\) independent of \\(Y_j\\), \\(i\\neq j\\)\nto assess validity of independence assumption, careful consideration of study design is essential\nviolations of independence often clear from sampling scheme\ne.g., if \\(Y_i\\)’s are time-ordered, may be serial correlation; \\(E[\\epsilon_i \\epsilon_{i+1}]\\neq 0\\)\ne.g., subjects in a study are clustered\ne.g., response measured repeatedly on each subject\nNote: recall that residuals are never independent\n\n\nIndependence Assumption: Autocorrelation : errors are correlated (sequenced) often occurs when response is measured over time \\(\\mbox{cov}(\\epsilon_i \\epsilon_{i+\\ell})\\neq 0\\), for some \\(\\ell\\) (lag) e.g., lag-2 autocorrelation: \\(E[\\epsilon_i \\epsilon_{i+1}]\\neq 0\\) \\(E[\\epsilon_i \\epsilon_{i+2}]\\neq 0\\) \\(E[\\epsilon_i \\epsilon_{i+k}]=0\\), for \\(k&gt;2\\)\n\n\nIndependence: Detecting Autocorrelation\nplot \\(\\widehat{\\epsilon}_i\\)’s versus \\(i\\) (index) positive autocorrelation: adjacent residuals have same sign negative autocorrelation: sign of residuals alternates Note: only if index \\(i\\) has a meaningful order, e.g. time plot \\(\\widehat{\\epsilon}_i\\) vs. \\(\\widehat{\\epsilon}_{i-1}\\) positive correlation: positive trend negative correlation: negative trend\n\n\nAutocorrelation: Durbin-Watson Test (Chap 14) consider: departure from independence in form of lag 1 autocorrelation (first order) \\(\\mbox{corr}(\\epsilon_i, \\epsilon_{i+1})=\\rho\\), \\(i=1,\\ldots,n-1\\) Durbin-Watson Test: hypotheses: \\(H_0: \\rho=0\\) vs. \\(H_1:\\rho &gt;

need to examine residuals may need to depart from linear regression altogether appeal to time series analysis (regression methods specially developed for time-ordered data)\n\n\nConstant Variance Assumption\n\n\nAssessing Constant Variance Plot \\(\\widehat{\\boldepsilon}\\) vs. \\(\\widehat{\\boldY}\\) to assess homogeneity assumption\nshould be a random scatter\ncommon departure: \\(|\\widehat{\\epsilon}_i|\\) increases with \\(\\widehat{Y}_i\\) (cone shape), implying that the variance is an increasing function of the mean common in linear modelling of count/rate data\nNote: residuals are heterogeneous, i.e., \\(Var(\\widehat{\\epsilon}_i)\\neq\\sigma^2\\), but shouldn’t have patterns\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\nModel Assumptions: Constant Variance If homogeneity fails \\(\\ldots\\) \\(\\widehat{\\boldbeta}\\): \\(\\widehat{\\sigma}^2\\): \\(\\widehat{Var}(\\widehat{\\boldbeta})\\): hypothesis tests, CI’s: Possible solutions: weighted least squares (Chapter 5.5.2 and 5.5.3) variance stabilizing transformations (Chapter 5.2) robust regression (Chapter 15.1) robust standard errors\n\n\nModel Assumptions: Constant Variance If homogeneity fails \\(\\ldots\\) \\(\\widehat{\\boldbeta}\\): remain valid \\(\\widehat{\\sigma}^2\\): not well defined \\(\\widehat{Var}(\\widehat{\\boldbeta})\\): invalid \\(Var\\{(\\boldX^T\\boldX)^{-1}\\boldX^T\\boldY\\}=(\\boldX^T\\boldX)^{-1}\\boldX^T{\\color{royalblue}Var(\\boldY)}\\boldX(\\boldX^T\\boldX)^{-1}\\) \\({\\color{white}{Var\\{(\\boldX^T\\boldX)^{-1}\\boldX^T\\boldY\\}}}\\neq (\\boldX^T\\boldX)^{-1}\\boldX^T{\\color{royalblue}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma^2\\boldI}}\\boldX(\\boldX^T\\boldX)^{-1}\\) hypothesis tests, CI’s: invalid because SE(\\(\\widehat{\\beta}\\)) invalid Possible solutions: weighted least squares (Chapter 5.5.2 and 5.5.3) variance stabilizing transformations (Chapter 5.2) robust regression (Chapter 15.1) robust standard errors\n\n\nWeighted Least Squares\nSuppose constant variance is violated, but the responses are uncorrelated, i.e., \\({\\boldepsilon}\\sim N({\\boldzero}, {\\boldW})\\), where \\({\\boldW}=\\mbox{diag}\\{\\boldsymbol{w}_1,\\ldots,\\boldsymbol{w}_n\\}\\) where \\(\\boldsymbol{w}_i\\neq \\boldsymbol{w}_j\\) for some \\(i\\neq j\\) \\(Var\\{(\\boldX^T\\boldX)^{-1}\\boldX^T\\boldY\\}=(\\boldX^T\\boldX)^{-1}\\boldX^T{\\color{royalblue}\\boldsymbol{\\boldW}}\\boldX(\\boldX^T\\boldX)^{-1}\\) We can estimate:\n_W &=& (^T^-1)^-1^T^-1\nVar(_W) & =& (^T^-1)^-1\nTypically, \\(\\boldW\\) is unknown and needs to be estimated from \\(\\widehat{\\epsilon}_i\\)’s\n\n\nVariance-Stabilizing Transformations\nVariance-stabilizing transformations (VST) can be used when strong evidence against the constant variance assumption exists\nIdea: often, when \\(Var(Y_i)\\) is not constant, it is a function of \\(E[Y_i]\\). Thus we: choose a function \\(g(\\cdot)\\) s.t. \\(Var(g(Y_i))\\) is not a function of \\(E[Y_i]\\) fit \\(g(\\boldY)=\\boldX\\boldgamma+\\bolddelta\\)\nCaveat: \\(\\boldgamma\\) has different interpretation than \\(\\boldbeta\\) in \\(\\boldY=\\boldX\\boldbeta+\\boldepsilon\\)\n\n\nNon-Constant Variance: Example\nSuppose \\(Y_i\\) follows a Poisson distribution From BIOS 601 we know \\(E[Y_i]=Var(Y_i)=\\boldX_i^T\\boldbeta\\) (non-constant!)\nSet \\(g(x)=\\sqrt{x}\\) due to the following approximation: \\[Var(g(Y_i)) \\approx  %Var\\{\\left.\\frac{\\partial g(x)}{\\partial x}\\right|_{x=E[Y_i]}   (Y_i)\\} =\n         \\left\\{ \\left.\\frac{\\partial g(x)}{\\partial\n            x} \\right|_{x=E[Y_i]} \\right\\}^2 Var(Y_i)\\]\nthis result is exact only when \\(g(x)\\) is linear here, \\(\\{\\partial g/\\partial x\\}^2=(4x)^{-1}\\), such that \\(Var(\\sqrt{Y_i})=1/4\\)\nTherefore, although \\(Var(Y_i)\\) is non-constant, \\(Var(\\sqrt{Y_i})\\) is a constant\n\n\nCommon VST’s\nExamples of variance-stabilizing transforms:\n\n\n\n\n\\(Var(Y_i)\\)\n\\(g(Y_i)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\sigma^2\\)\n\\(Y_i\\)\n\n\n\\(E[Y_i]\\)\n\\(\\sqrt{Y_i}\\)\n\n\n\\(E[Y_i]^2\\)\n\\(\\log(Y_i)\\)\n\n\n\\(E[Y_i]^3\\)\n\\(1/\\sqrt{Y_i}\\)\n\n\n\\(E[Y_i]^4\\)\n\\(1/Y_i\\)\n\n\n\n\nThese are ordered from weakest to strongest \\(\\ldots\\) We don’t know exactly which one to choose. So: Plot residuals vs fitted values Use prior experience Involves some trial and error\n\n\nRobust standard errors\nRobust standard errors correctly estimate variability of parameter estimates even under non-constant variance Use empirical estimates of the variance in \\(Y\\) at each \\(X\\) value rather than assuming this variance is the same for all \\(X\\) values Regression point estimates will be unchanged Robust or empirical standard errors will give correct confidence intervals and p-values In R: lmtest::coeftest()\n\n\nNormality Assumption\n\n\nNormality Assumption Several ways to check assumption that \\(\\epsilon_i\\sim N(0,\\sigma^2)\\) normality: histogram (stem & leaf plots)\nbox-whisker plots (boxplots)\nquantile-to-quantile (Q-Q) plots\nShapiro-Wilks Test (among other tests for normal distribution)\n\n\nApproach 1: Histogram\nHistogram of \\(\\widehat{\\epsilon}_i\\)’s: should approximate the shape of a zero-mean normal distribution; i.e., symmetric bell-shaped light tailed\nCaveat: Need a fairly large number of individuals to get reliable information from histogram Histograms of the same data but using different bin sizes (breaks) and/or different cut-points may look quite different\nQ: Why not simply plot histogram of \\(Y_i\\)’s?

Once we “plug in\" observed data, we have estimates.\n\n\nReview and Preview A typical goal of the analysis is to infer (draw inference on) the values of \\(\\beta_0,\\beta_1\\) supported by the data (point and interval estimates), as well as test if particular values of \\(\\beta_0,\\beta_1\\) are consistent with the data (hypothesis testing where e.g., \\(H_0:\\beta_1=b_1\\), and \\(b_1\\) is a given constant such as 0). To draw inference (interval estimates or tests) we need to know the sampling distribution of the estimators \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_0,\\widehat{\\beta}_1\\), i.e., What are the average values of \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_0,\\widehat{\\beta}_1\\) if we were able to take repeated samples of the population How much variation is there in the values of \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_0,\\widehat{\\beta}_1\\) from one random sample to another Given the model assumptions, we can derive Average values: \\(E[\\widehat{\\beta}_0]=\\beta_0\\), \\(E[\\widehat{\\beta}_1]=\\beta_1\\) Variation: \\(Var(\\widehat{\\beta}_0)=\\sigma^2(\\frac{1}{n}+\\frac{\\bar{X}^2}{SSX})\\), \\(Var(\\widehat{\\beta}_1)=\\frac{\\sigma^2}{SSX}\\)\n\n\nReview and Preview Since \\(E[\\widehat{\\beta}_0]=\\beta_0\\) and \\(E[\\widehat{\\beta}_1]=\\beta_1\\), we know that the estimators (formulas) will give estimates that are centered at the true values.\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n0.7 Histogram of observed values of \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_1\\) if we took many repeated samples from the population Since we have only one particular dataset (sample), we are only able to observe one value of the slope, not the whole distribution\n\n\nThe formulas for \\(Var(\\widehat{\\beta}_0),Var(\\widehat{\\beta}_1)\\) tell us how much spread there is in this histogram. However, the formulas also involve \\(\\sigma^2\\) (the variance of errors). So we further estimate \\(\\sigma^2\\) before drawing inference.

    "text": "Questions\nThe following questions were adapted from this textbook.\n\nQuestion 1\nPlease use R code to determine the following answers. (adapted from problem 3.3 in Applied Regression Analysis and Other Multivariable Methods)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType ?pnorm in the console to get some information on a potentially helpful function.\n\n\n\n\nPart a\nFrom a normal distribution with mean 4 and standard deviation 6, what is \\(P(X&gt;2)\\)?\n\n\nPart b\nFrom a normal distribution with mean 4 and standard deviation 6, for what value (in place of ??) would \\(P(X&gt;??) = 0.1\\)?\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\nSuppose that the height (\\(H\\)) of assigned-male-at-birth (AMAB) patients registered at a clinic has the normal distribution with mean 70 inches and variance 4. (adapted from problem 3.11 in Applied Regression Analysis and Other Multivariable Methods)\n\nPart a\nFor a random sample of patients of size \\(n = 25\\), the expression \\(P(\\bar{H} &lt; 65)\\), in which \\(\\bar{H}\\) denotes the sample mean height, is equivalent to saying \\(P(Z &lt; ?)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(Z\\) is a standard normal random variable.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nUsing the pnorm function, show that the probability expressions in Part a are equal.\n\n\nPart c\nFind an interval \\((a, b)\\) such that \\(P(a&lt; \\bar{H} &lt;b) = 0.80\\) for the same random sample in Part a.\n\n\n\nQuestion 3\nTest the null hypothesis that the true population average height is the same for two independent groups from one hospital versus the alternative hypothesis that these two population averages are different, using the following data:\n\nGroup 1: [69.25, 72.80, 68.73, 72.01, 70.36, 71.49, 72.73]\nGroup 2: [67.54, 68.51, 71.84, 70.59, 71.52, 71.50]\n\nYou may assume that the populations from which the data come are each normally distributed, with equal population variances. What conclusion should be drawn, with \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease attempt this problem using R. Take a look at the information for the t.test function. You will need to set x, y, alternative, and var.equal=T. You can use the below groups coded in R.\n\n\n\n\ngrp1 = c(69.25, 72.80, 68.73, 72.01, 70.36, 71.49, 72.73)\ngrp2 = c(67.54, 68.51, 71.84, 70.59, 71.52, 71.50)\n\n\n\nQuestion 4\nThe choice of an alternative hypothesis (\\(H_A\\) or \\(H_1\\)) should depend primarily on (choose all that apply). Explain your reasoning.\n\nthe data obtained from the study.\nwhat the investigator is interested in determining.\nthe critical region.\nthe significance level.\nthe power of the test.\n\n\n\nQuestion 5\nVisit this site on dplyr.\nFor one of the functions that we have not discussed in class, please use it on the dds.discr dataset. Please write in words what you would like to perform, then write the code.\nNote: the dds.discr dataset is an .Rda file. Instead of using read_csv() or read_excel(), you can use load().\n\n\nQuestion 6\nThe accompanying data CH05Q01 gives the dry weights (Y) of 11 chick embryos ranging in age from 6 to 16 days (X ). Also given in the data are the values of the common logarithms of the weights (Z).\n\nLoad the dataset using the readxl package.\n\nThis readxl package was installed as a part of the tidyverse, however it does not get loaded when you load the tidyverse package and thus you need to do that separately.\nUse the command read_excel(), as shown below\n\n\n\nlibrary(readxl)\n# you might need to update the location of the data file\n# you can choose whatever name you like for the tibble when loading it into R's workspace \nch05q01 &lt;- read_excel(\"./data/CH05Q01.xls\")\n\n\nPart a\nCreate two scatterplots in R using ggplot:\n\nBetween age (X) and dry weight (Y)\nBetween age (X) and log10 dry weight (Z)\n\nObserve the following two scatter diagrams. Describe the relationships between age (X) and dry weight (Y) and between age and log10 dry weight (Z).\n\n\nPart b\nState the population simple linear regression models for these two regressions: Y regressed on X and Z regressed on X.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is asking for the regression models BEFORE you find the values of the coefficients.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart c\nDetermine the least-squares estimates of each of the regression lines in part (b).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow get the regression coefficients using R and plug them into the regression models from (b). You can get the coefficients from the R output!\n\n\n\n\n\nPart d\nUsing ggplot, create the respective best-fit lines on your plots. Which of the two regression lines has the better fit? Based on your answers to parts (a)–(c), is it more appropriate to run a linear regression of Y on X or of Z on X? Explain.\n\n\nPart e (to be covered on Monday 1/22)\nFor the regression that you chose as being more appropriate in part (d), find 95% confidence intervals for the true slope and intercept. Interpret each interval with regard to the null hypothesis that the true value is 0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can get the CI’s from the R output\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate 1/21/2024\n\n\n\nI removed some of the instructions because they were a little confusing. No need to go through the formal process of a hypothesis test.\n\n\n\n\nPart f (to be covered on Monday 1/22)\nFor the regression that you chose as being more appropriate in part (d), add 95% confidence and prediction bands. Using your sketch, find and interpret an approximate 95% confidence interval for the mean response of an 8-day-old chick.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate 1/21/2024\n\n\n\nI removed prediction bands because we did not cover them!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate 1/22/2024\n\n\n\nYou do NOT need to do this problem (Question 6, part f). We did NOT get to it on Monday, so I don’t expect you to do it for the homework."

    "text": "Lab activities\n\n1. Reading and listening activities\n\n1.1 Article: Implicit and explicit anti-fat bias: The role of weight-related attitudes and beliefs\nThis article will serve as a reference point for our project. The article is meant to introduce social scientists’ approaches to research and analyses. However, the article is not meant to be a basis for which we perform our analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThis article discusses anti-fat bias. It uses words that may be triggering to larger-bodied people.\n\n\nPlease read sections 1 - 2, through 2.2 (“Procedures and measures”). Answer the following questions:\n\nIn your own words, what is anti-fat bias?\nWhat were the three social theoretical models that the paper discusses? Which do you personally think is the biggest contributor to anti-fat bias and why?\nFrom the following measures in section 2.2, select two and discuss why the named measure may or may not accurately represent the italicized statement taken from the IAT questionnaire. Feel free to answer this question after taking the IAT yourself.\n\nSelf-perception of weight\nThin/fat group identity\nControllability of weight\nAwareness of societal standards\nInternalization of societal standards\n\nFor example, for Self-perception of weight, the italicized statement is the following statement outlined in red:\n\n\n\n1.2 Podcast: Anti-Fat Bias by Maintenance Phase\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThis podcast shares the experience of one of its hosts that involves anti-fat bias. This may be triggering if you have experienced this type of bias.\n\n\nThis is an optional listening for this lab, but I highly encourage you listen at some point this quarter. This is a really good way to see how research can be integrated into conversation and experience.\nIf you decide to listen, feel free to share a quote that most impacted you.\n\n\n\n2. Familiarizing ourselves with the Implicit Association Test (IAT)\n\n2.1 Learn more about the test\nVisit the Project Implicit site, and read about the test. What is your initial reaction to the test? What questions about the test do you have? Do you have any questions about the test’s validity? The point here is not to attempt to discredit the test itself, but see what specific questions the test can help us answer and what is outside the scope of our analysis. For example, are there any potential issues with the fact that people are self-selected to take the test? Does that mean our sample is representative of our population? Is it an issue that someone can take the test more than once?\nThis exercise will serve as a good starting point for the discussion section of our project report. The more effort you put in here and now, the more prepared you will be for the report.\n\n\n2.2 Take the test\nYou will spend 15 minutes taking the IAT. You can go to the Project Implicit website, register, and select a specific test to take. Once registered, you can click “Take a Test,” read the Preliminary Information, and then click “I wish to proceed” at the bottom. Then you can click the button “Weight IAT” to take this particular test.\nI will not check that you have completed this test, but it will help you understand the data you are analyzing.\n\n\n\n3. Get a sense of how you would like to analyze the data\nFor our project, we will examine the association betwen the IAT score and one other variable. From the above article, and the introduced variables in section 2.2, which association are you most interested in analyzing? Please write this in the form of a research question.\nWe will have a chance to adjust our research question once we have explored the data in Lab 2.\n\n\n4. Compile above work into an introduction\nAt this point, you have done a lot of the work needed to write an introduction for your report. Write a brief description of anti-fat bias, IAT, your research question, and the context for the question. This description should be in complete sentences and written as a single paragraph.\nIn the next lab, we will work on a summary of the dataset (e.g. where are the data from, when were they collected, how many subjects, what are the variables, what are the exposure and outcomes variables of interest, etc.)."

(adapted from problem 3.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType ?pnorm in the console to get some information on a potentially helpful function.\n\n\n\n\nPart a\nFrom a normal distribution with mean 4 and standard deviation 6, what is \\(P(X&gt;2)\\)?\n\n\nPart b\nFrom a normal distribution with mean 4 and standard deviation 6, for what value (in place of ??) would \\(P(X&gt;??) = 0.1\\)?\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\nSuppose that the height (\\(H\\)) of assigned-male-at-birth (AMAB) patients registered at a clinic has the normal distribution with mean 70 inches and variance 4. (adapted from problem 3.11)\n\nPart a\nFor a random sample of patients of size \\(n = 25\\), the expression \\(P(\\bar{H} &lt; 65)\\), in which \\(\\bar{H}\\) denotes the sample mean height, is equivalent to saying \\(P(Z &lt; ?)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(Z\\) is a standard normal random variable.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nUsing the pnorm function, show that the probability expressions in Part a are equal.\n\n\nPart c\nFind an interval \\((a, b)\\) such that \\(P(a&lt; \\bar{H} &lt;b) = 0.80\\) for the same random sample in Part a.\n\n\n\nQuestion 3\nTest the null hypothesis that the true population average height is the same for two independent groups from one hospital versus the alternative hypothesis that these two population averages are different, using the following data:\n\nGroup 1: [69.25, 72.80, 68.73, 72.01, 70.36, 71.49, 72.73]\nGroup 2: [67.54, 68.51, 71.84, 70.59, 71.52, 71.50]\n\nYou may assume that the populations from which the data come are each normally distributed, with equal population variances. What conclusion should be drawn, with \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease attempt this problem using R. Take a look at the information for the t.test function. You will need to set x, y, alternative, and var.equal=T. You can use the below groups coded in R.\n\n\n\n\ngrp1 = c(69.25, 72.80, 68.73, 72.01, 70.36, 71.49, 72.73)\ngrp2 = c(67.54, 68.51, 71.84, 70.59, 71.52, 71.50)\n\n\n\nQuestion 4\nThe choice of an alternative hypothesis (\\(H_A\\) or \\(H_1\\)) should depend primarily on (choose all that apply)\n\nthe data obtained from the study.\nwhat the investigator is interested in determining.\nthe critical region.\nthe significance level.\nthe power of the test.\n\n\n\nQuestion 5\nThe accompanying table gives the dry weights (Y ) of 11 chick embryos ranging in age from 6 to 16 days (X ). Also given in the table are the values of the common logarithms of the weights (Z).\n\nLoad the dataset using the readxl package.\n\nThis readxl package was installed as a part of the tidyverse, however it does not get loaded when you load the tidyverse package and thus you need to do that separately.\nUse the command read_excel(), as shown below\n\n\n\nlibrary(readxl)\n# you might need to update the location of the data file\n# you can choose whatever name you like for the tibble when loading it into R's workspace \nch05q01 &lt;- read_excel(\"./data/CH05Q01.xls\")\n\n\n\nPart a\nCreate the scatterplots in R using ggplot the above dataset. Observe the following two scatter diagrams. Describe the relationships between age (X) and dry weight (Y) and between age and log10 dry weight (Z).\n\n\nPart b\nState the simple linear regression models for these two regressions: Y regressed on X and Z regressed on X.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is asking for the regression models BEFORE you find the values of the coefficients.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart c\nDetermine the least-squares estimates of each of the regression lines in part (b).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow get the regression coefficients using R and plug them into the regression models from (b). You can get the coefficients from the R output - you don’t have to use the formulas.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart d\nCreate a line on your plots. Which of the two regression lines has the better fit? Based on your answers to parts (a)–(c), is it more appropriate to run a linear regression of Y on X or of Z on X? Explain.\n\n\nPart e\nFor the regression that you chose as being more appropriate in part (d), find 95% confidence intervals for the true slope and intercept. Interpret each interval with regard to the null hypothesis that the true value is 0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can get the CI’s from the R output - you don’t have to use the formulas.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart f\nFor the regression that you chose as being more appropriate in part (d), add 95% confidence and prediction bands. Using your sketch, find and interpret an approximate 95% confidence interval for the mean response of an 8-day-old chick."

Access and download the data\nThis serves as good practice for accessing data that is online or needs to be downloaded from a collaborator.\nData can be accessed here. Under “Weight IAT 2004-2022” there are several drop down menus:\n\nI opened the first “Datasets & Codebooks,” then selected “OSF Storage (United States).” Once selected, the “Download as zip” option pops up in the top right part of the Files section.\n\nWe will be working with the Weight_IAT.public.2021.csv dataset. Please locate the zip file called Weight IAT.public.2021-CSV.zip . T0 download, you need to click the row of the zip file, but you can’t click the name of the zip file. If a link opens, then you clicked the name. If the row is highlighted blue and clickable “Download” and “View” buttons appear on the top right, then you selected it correctly! (See below image for what it should look like.)\n\nThen click the “Download” button to download! Note that the name does not have an underscore between “Weight” and “IAT.” I like to have my datasets named without spaces, so I will replace the space with an underscore.\nFor the codebook, perform the same process for the file named: Weight_IAT_public_2021_codebook.xlsx\nYou will need to unzip the actual data.\nMove the data to a folder that you can easily access as you work from this document. I like to have a folder named data to house my data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask Summary\n\n\n\nDownload the 2021 data and codebook from the archives and store in accessible folder.\n\n\n\n\n2. Load data and needed packages\nFirst, load the packages that you will need in the remainder of this lab. You can add to this as you need to. At the top of your R code chunk, you can add the following option to repress the messages from the loading packages:\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gtsummary)\nlibrary(here)\nif(!require(lubridate)) { install.packages(\"lubridate\"); library(lubridate) }\n\nUsing R, load the data (csv file) into this document. Note that this is a csv file that we can load with basic R packages. Name your dataset something that feels intuitive to you and will distinguish it from other datasets that you work with.\nLoading the csv file every time you render will take a long time. One way to speed this up is by saving the data as an rda file (R data file). Change the following R code to save the rda file. You will also need to remove the #| eval: false at the top of the code chunk once you have corrected the code. If you are confused on the syntax, don’t forget that you can use ?save for more information.\n\nsave(&lt;whatever you called the read csv file&gt;, file = \"Where you would like to save the file with its name\")\n\nCheck that you have an rda file where you saved it. Now use load() with the file path to load the rda data here.\n\nload(file = \"Where you would like to save the file with its name\")\n\nAt this point, if you think you loaded the file correctly, add #| eval: false to the code chunk where you loaded the csv file and back to the chunk where you saved the rda file.\nTake a glimpse at the data to make sure you loaded it correctly.\nHow many rows and columns are in the dataset? Do you think we will need all these variables for our analysis?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask Summary\n\n\n\nRead csv, save as rda, load rda, glimpse at data.\nHow many rows and columns are in the dataset? Do you think we will need all these variables for our analysis?\n\n\n\n\n3. Data wrangling\nAs you go through this process, it is important that you look at the codebook for more information on each variable.\n\n3.1 What’s our target population?\nAs many of you mentioned in Lab 1, individuals taking the IAT test are not necessarily representative of the world population. I want you to articulate the target population that you think our analysis can give information about. To what population can we generalize our analysis results? We can get very specific with this population, but try to restrict your population to 3-5 characteristics.\nAfter you articulate the population, I want to add one more restriction to our population: US residency. The sample includes individuals residing in many different countries. Since we are discussing attitudes and beliefs that is inherently connected to society and culture, I think it is important that we restrict our analysis and discussion to a country that we have some social experience in. Thus, let’s restrict our data to the US only by filtering the variable countryres to category 1 (corresponding to the US).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nDescribe our target population. Keep your description to 3-5 characteristics, not including our restriction on the US population.\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Restrict your analysis to 1 outcome and 9 possible covariates/predictors\nWe are going to restrict our analysis to the single outcome, IAT score, which is named D_biep.Thin_Good_all. You can rename this variable.\nWe will also restrict our analysis to the following 9 potential variables so our work is a little more manageable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nFrom the following 8 attitudes and beliefs, please select 3 that you think will be the most important variables related to your research question. In 1-2 lines, briefly explain why you chose each variable. This can be informal and bulleted.\n\n\n(Make sure you chose the variable that is part of your research question!)\n\nExplicit anti-fat bias (att7)\nSelf-perception of weight (iam_001)\nFat group identity (identfat_001 )\nThin group identity (identthen_001 )\nControllability of weight of others (controlother_001)\nControllability of weight of yourself (controlyou_001)\nAwareness of societal standards (mostpref_001 )\nInternalization of societal standards (important_001)\n\nWe will start our data exploration with the following 4 demographic variables:\n\nAge (we need to construct)\nRace (raceomb_002 or raceombmulti)\nEthnicity\nSex assigned at birth (birthSex)\n\nPlease pick 2 additional variables to include in your analysis:\n\nEducation (edu)\nGender (genderIdentity)\nSelf-reported BMI (through self-reported height and weight)\nPolitical identity\nReligion\n\nI have chosen these variables for a mixture of reasons. For example, I have left out variables about residence and occupation because those variables have hundreds of categories that would be overwhelming in linear regression. For the 4 required demographic variables, I chose age because I really want us to get practice with a continuous variable. I chose race and ethnicity because of the intertwined history of racism and anti-fat bias in Western countries (including the U.S. where most participants reside).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA note of the available variables on race\n\n\n\nThe dataset has two separate race variables. One has mutually exclusive categories (raceomb_002) and the other allows participants to make multiple selections (raceombmulti). The former (raceomb_002) allows one participant to identify with only one race category.\nImportant lesson from We All Count about using a multiple selection race question. We can try out all these options!\n\n\nFinally, I chose sex assigned at birth because adults in 2021 in the US were likely raised in a society where your sex assigned at birth impacted the gender stereotypes that you were raised in, which could impact exposure to diet culture. This in addition to the many medical conditions associated with one’s sex assigned at birth that may affect weight. The reason why I am leaving gender as an optional variable is because the question on gender allows participants to chose multiple options. The binary sex assigned at birth will make our analysis a little easier from a statistics stand point. Unfortunately, we need to balance achievable learning objectives and the most appropriate variable. Since I have required race as a variable and has a multi-level option, I do not want to overload our analysis with another multi-level variable. Sex assigned at birth will not create more work for you (that is outside of the course objectives) while capturing medical conditions and some of the societal impact of diet culture. This is certainly a limitation in our analysis that we should address in our discussion. I do encourage you to look into gender if the binary sex assigned at birth does not feel right for you. I am happy to help!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA word on self-reported BMI\n\n\n\nThis variable is rooted in racism and anti-fat bias. The American Medical Association made a few press releases on policies using BMI as a measure, with alternative measures (frankly, just other measures of fatness to use as a diagnostic tool instead of checking true indicators of health). However, I can think of a couple examples where BMI might help us understand some context in this research, so I have left it as an option. Although still self-reported, it might be interesting to see how BMI (which is the closest measurement available in this dataset to an “objective” measure of fatness) is related to individuals’ attitudes and beliefs. I am not saying there is anything to the relationship, but it might be worth checking out if you are interested.\nI will also say, in this dataset, there are MANY issues constructing the variable for BMI from height and weight. If you do not feel strongly about including it, I would suggest you avoid the variable self-reported BMI. It is not worth bringing in a racist and anti-fat variable into the dataset if you do not have a specific use for it. If you do plan to use it, please come to me for help as early as possible!\n\n\nIf you would like to investigate a variable outside the list, please let me know by emailing or chatting with me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nUsing R, select your identified variables from your dataset. Your new dataset should have 10 columns for the 10 variables.\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Manipulating variables that are coded as numeric variables\nMany variables in this dataset are coded as numeric values, but have specific categories linking up to the numbers. Using mutate() and cases() similar to our Data Management lesson, please create a new categorical variable with the specified categories from the codebook. Make sure that you create a variable with a new name! Since some of these variables are ordered categories, we will investigate if it’s appropriate to use the numeric or categorical version of the variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of how I would create new variable for self-perception of weight (iam_001):\n\n\n\nBy looking at the codebook, I see that respondents answer the following question: “Currently, I am:”\n\n“Very underweight”\n“Moderately underweight”\n“Slightly underweight”\n“Neither underweight nor underweight”\n“Slightly overweight”\n“Moderately overweight”\n“Very overweight”\n\nIf I look at the data as is, I see that the variable is numeric.\n\niat_2021 %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(iam_001) %&gt;%\n  tbl_summary()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      Characteristic\n      N = 465,8861\n    \n  \n  \n    iam_001\n\n        1\n2,023 (0.6%)\n        2\n7,902 (2.4%)\n        3\n24,399 (7.3%)\n        4\n148,081 (44%)\n        5\n88,566 (27%)\n        6\n43,090 (13%)\n        7\n18,978 (5.7%)\n        Unknown\n132,847\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      1 n (%)\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nAgain, I want to create a varaible with the answers instead of numbers, so I will change transform the variable to include the text:\n\niat_2021 = iat_2021 %&gt;%\n  mutate(iam_001_f = case_match(iam_001,\n                             7 ~ \"Very overweight\",\n                             6 ~ \"Moderately overweight\",\n                             5 ~ \"Slightly overweight\",\n                             4 ~ \"Neither underweight nor underweight\",\n                             3 ~ \"Slightly underweight\",\n                             2 ~ \"Moderately underweight\",\n                             1 ~ \"Very underweight\",\n                             .default = NA # to add NA if unknown\n                             ) %&gt;% factor())\niat_2021 %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(iam_001_f) %&gt;%\n  tbl_summary()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      Characteristic\n      N = 465,8861\n    \n  \n  \n    iam_001_f\n\n        Moderately overweight\n43,090 (13%)\n        Moderately underweight\n7,902 (2.4%)\n        Neither underweight nor underweight\n148,081 (44%)\n        Slightly overweight\n88,566 (27%)\n        Slightly underweight\n24,399 (7.3%)\n        Very overweight\n18,978 (5.7%)\n        Very underweight\n2,023 (0.6%)\n        Unknown\n132,847\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      1 n (%)\n    \n  \n\n\n\nggplot(data=iat_2021) +\n  geom_boxplot(aes(x = iam_001_f, y = IAT_score))\n\nWarning: Removed 129215 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_boxplot()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nI have called the new variable iam_001_f to indicate that the variable is not in factor form. You can also call it something like iam_001_cat to indicate the categorical form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nIdentify and list the variables that are coded numerically and correspond to categories. Create a new variable for the categorical/factor version of the variable. It is up to you to check that your code ran properly!! If you are using multi-choice categorical variables (might include race, gender), then do not convert the variable yet!\n\n\n\n\n3.4 Creating age from birth date and test date\nThis dataset does not have an available “age” variable. However, we have enough information to determine each individual’s age from the test date and their self-reported birth date. We can use the lubridate package to configure the age. First, we need to use make_date() to construct the birth date and test date. Below, I have implemented make_date() to make the birth date.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nFrom the codebook, find the variables that we can use to construct the test date. Then use make_date() to create the test date.\n\n\n\niat_2021 = iat_2021 %&gt;%\n  mutate(birthdate = make_date(month = birthmonth, year = birthyear), \n         testdate = make_date(month = month, year = year))\n\nOnce the two dates are created, we can use further use lubridate to calculate the age in years. This code is a little complicated, so here is an example of how I have created age:\n\niat_2021 = iat_2021 %&gt;%\n  mutate(age = interval(start = birthdate, end = testdate) %&gt;%\n          as.period() %&gt;% year()) %&gt;%\n  select(-birthmonth, -birthyear, -year, -month, \n         -testdate, -birthdate)\n\nNote that the name of my dataset is iat_2021 and I feed it into mutate(). Within mutate(), I assigned age to the interval between the name of my birth date (birthdate) and the name of my test date (testdate). I need to convert the interval to a period of time (as.period()), then to a measurement of years (year()).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nFollowing the above example, create an age variable that measures the years between individuals’ birth and test date. Then remove the variables used to make age.\n\n\n\n\n3.5 If you chose BMI, create the variable\nRaw data from weight and height are categorical. This is according to the codebook associated with this dataset. Please find your codebook file named Weight_IAT_public_2021_codebook.csv . You can find the value names for myweight_002 and myheight_002.\n\nFor example, in the weight variable,\n\nmost categories identify a lower limit to the weight in the group. One example group is weight is greater than or equal to 200 pounds and less than 205 pounds (labelled as “200 lb :: 91 kg”).\nthe first category for weight is “below 50lb:: 23kg” with 258 observations\nthe last category for weight is “above 440lb:: above 200kg” with 295 observations\n\nWhile the 5 groups of weight leading up the last category have 33, 28, 34, 20, and 89 observations, respectively.\n\n\n\nI will post an extra resource outlining some of my work on the BMI variable.\n\n\n3.6 Make a new dataset with only complete cases\nHandling missing data is outside the scope of our class. There are many techniques to handling missing data, but we will use complete case analysis. This means we will only use observations that have information for every variable we chose. The function drop_na() will give you the complete cases. You can feed your dataset into the function and assign it as a new dataframe.\nFor example:\n\nnew_df = old_df %&gt;% drop_na()\n\n\n\n\n4. Some exploratory data analysis\n\n4.1 Peek at your outcome\nThis serves as a check to make sure we are all looking at the correct outcome: IAT score.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nPlease plot a histogram of the IAT scores. What do you notice about the outcome?\n\n\n\n\n4.2 Univariate exploratory data analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nUsing ggplot or tables, visualize your variables. Get a sense of each variable’s distribution. Do you notice anything out of the ordinary?\n\n\n\n\n4.3 Bivariate exploratory data analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nTake a look at the scatterplot, violin, or box plot of IAT score and your variable of interest. Use R and ggplot to make this plot. If your variable of interest is categorical, then make sure to use a violin or boxplot.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Revisit your research question\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nPlease restate the research question that you proposed in Lab 1. Please make sure it is only one question, one sentence long. What are your thoughts on the research question now that we looked at the data? Feel free to change it now that we’ve looked at the data. If you change your question, make sure 4.2 reflects the new research question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn research, we typically do NOT change our research question after looking at the data! Researchers typically form their questions from other research and their expertise. We may not have expertise in this field and we have not been studying implicit bias, so I want to be a little more flexible with our analysis."

Access and download the data\nThis serves as good practice for accessing data that is online or needs to be downloaded from a collaborator.\nData can be accessed here. Under “Weight IAT 2004-2022” there are several drop down menus:\n\nI opened the first “Datasets & Codebooks,” then selected “OSF Storage (United States).” Once selected, the “Download as zip” option pops up in the top right part of the Files section.\n\nWe will be working with the Weight_IAT.public.2021.csv dataset. Please locate the zip file called Weight IAT.public.2021-CSV.zip . T0 download, you need to click the row of the zip file, but you can’t click the name of the zip file. If a link opens, then you clicked the name. If the row is highlighted blue and clickable “Download” and “View” buttons appear on the top right, then you selected it correctly! (See below image for what it should look like.)\n\nThen click the “Download” button to download! Note that the name does not have an underscore between “Weight” and “IAT.” I like to have my datasets named without spaces, so I will replace the space with an underscore.\nFor the codebook, perform the same process for the file named: Weight_IAT_public_2021_codebook.xlsx\nYou will need to unzip the actual data.\nMove the data to a folder that you can easily access as you work from this document. I like to have a folder named data to house my data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask Summary\n\n\n\nDownload the 2021 data and codebook from the archives and store in accessible folder.\n\n\n\n\n2. Load data and needed packages\nFirst, load the packages that you will need in the remainder of this lab. You can add to this as you need to. At the top of your R code chunk, you can add the following option to repress the messages from the loading packages:\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gtsummary)\nlibrary(here)\nif(!require(lubridate)) { install.packages(\"lubridate\"); library(lubridate) }\n\nUsing R, load the data (csv file) into this document. Note that this is a csv file that we can load with basic R packages. Name your dataset something that feels intuitive to you and will distinguish it from other datasets that you work with.\n\n\n[1] \"/Users/wakim/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-OregonHealth&ScienceUniversity/Teaching/Classes/W2024_BSTA_512_612/W2024_BSTA_512\"\n\n\nLoading the csv file every time you render will take a long time. One way to speed this up is by saving the data as an rda file (R data file). Change the following R code to save the rda file. You will also need to remove the #| eval: false at the top of the code chunk once you have corrected the code. If you are confused on the syntax, don’t forget that you can use ?save for more information.\n\nsave(&lt;whatever you called the read csv file&gt;, file = \"Where you would like to save the file with its name\")\n\nCheck that you have an rda file where you saved it. Now use load() with the file path to load the rda data here.\n\nload(file = \"Where you would like to save the file with its name\")\n\nAt this point, if you think you loaded the file correctly, add #| eval: false to the code chunk where you loaded the csv file and back to the chunk where you saved the rda file.\nTake a glimpse at the data to make sure you loaded it correctly.\nHow many rows and columns are in the dataset? Do you think we will need all these variables for our analysis?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask Summary\n\n\n\nRead csv, save as rda, load rda, glimpse at data.\nHow many rows and columns are in the dataset? Do you think we will need all these variables for our analysis?\n\n\n\n\n3. Data wrangling\nAs you go through this process, it is important that you look at the codebook for more information on each variable.\n\n3.1 What’s our target population?\nAs many of you mentioned in Lab 1, individuals taking the IAT test are not necessarily representative of the world population. I want you to articulate the target population that you think our analysis can give information about. To what population can we generalize our analysis results? We can get very specific with this population, but try to restrict your population to 3-5 characteristics.\nAfter you articulate the population, I want to add one more restriction to our population: US residency. The sample includes individuals residing in many different countries. Since we are discussing attitudes and beliefs that is inherently connected to society and culture, I think it is important that we restrict our analysis and discussion to a country that we have some social experience in. Thus, let’s restrict our data to the US only by filtering the variable countryres to category 1 (corresponding to the US).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nDescribe our target population. Keep your description to 3-5 characteristics, not including our restriction on the US population.\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Restrict your analysis to 1 outcome and 9 possible covariates/predictors\nWe are going to restrict our analysis to the single outcome, IAT score, which is named D_biep.Thin_Good_all. You can rename this variable.\nWe will also restrict our analysis to the following 9 potential variables so our work is a little more manageable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nFrom the following 7 attitudes and beliefs, please select 3 that you think will be the most important variables related to your research question. In 1-2 lines, briefly explain why you chose each variable. This can be informal and bulleted.\n\n\n(Make sure you chose the variable that is part of your research question!)\n\nSelf-perception of weight (iam_001)\nFat group identity (identfat_001 )\nThin group identity (identthen_001 )\nControllability of weight of others (controlother_001)\nControllability of weight of yourself (controlyou_001)\nAwareness of societal standards (mostpref_001 )\nInternalization of societal standards (important_001)\n\nWe will start our data exploration with the following 4 demographic variables:\n\nAge (we need to construct)\nRace (raceomb_002 or raceombmulti)\nEthnicity\nSex assigned at birth (birthSex)\n\nPlease pick 2 additional variables to include in your analysis:\n\nEducation (edu)\nGender (genderIdentity)\nSelf-reported BMI (through self-reported height and weight)\nPolitical identity\nReligion\n\nI have chosen these variables for a mixture of reasons. For example, I have left out variables about residence and occupation because those variables have hundreds of categories that would be overwhelming in linear regression. For the 4 required demographic variables, I chose age because I really want us to get practice with a continuous variable. I chose race and ethnicity because of the intertwined history of racism and anti-fat bias in Western countries (including the U.S. where most participants reside).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA note of the available variables on race\n\n\n\nThe dataset has two separate race variables. One has mutually exclusive categories (raceomb_002) and the other allows participants to make multiple selections (raceombmulti). The former (raceomb_002) allows one participant to identify with only one race category.\nImportant lesson from We All Count about using a multiple selection race question. We can try out all these options!\n\n\nFinally, I chose sex assigned at birth because adults in 2021 in the US were likely raised in a society where your sex assigned at birth impacted the gender stereotypes that you were raised in, which could impact exposure to diet culture. This in addition to the many medical conditions associated with one’s sex assigned at birth that may affect weight. The reason why I am leaving gender as an optional variable is because the question on gender allows participants to chose multiple options. The binary sex assigned at birth will make our analysis a little easier from a statistics stand point. Unfortunately, we need to balance achievable learning objectives and the most appropriate variable. Since I have required race as a variable and has a multi-level option, I do not want to overload our analysis with another multi-level variable. Sex assigned at birth will not create more work for you (that is outside of the course objectives) while capturing medical conditions and some of the societal impact of diet culture. This is certainly a limitation in our analysis that we should address in our discussion. I do encourage you to look into gender if the binary sex assigned at birth does not feel right for you. I am happy to help!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA word on self-reported BMI\n\n\n\nThis variable is rooted in racism and anti-fat bias. The American Medical Association made a few press releases on policies using BMI as a measure, with alternative measures (frankly, just other measures of fatness to use as a diagnostic tool instead of checking true indicators of health). However, I can think of a couple examples where BMI might help us understand some context in this research, so I have left it as an option. Although still self-reported, it might be interesting to see how BMI (which is the closest measurement available in this dataset to an “objective” measure of fatness) is related to individuals’ attitudes and beliefs. I am not saying there is anything to the relationship, but it might be worth checking out if you are interested.\nI will also say, in this dataset, there are MANY issues constructing the variable for BMI from height and weight. If you do not feel strongly about including it, I would suggest you avoid the variable self-reported BMI. It is not worth bringing in a racist and anti-fat variable into the dataset if you do not have a specific use for it. If you do plan to use it, please come to me for help as early as possible!\n\n\nIf you would like to investigate a variable outside the list, please let me know by emailing or chatting with me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nUsing R, select your identified variables from your dataset. Your new dataset should have 10 columns for the 10 variables.\n\n\n\n\n [1] \" \"             \"[2]\"           \"[1]\"           \"[3]\"          \n [5] \"[1,3]\"         \"[5]\"           \"[1,5,6]\"       \"[2,5]\"        \n [9] \"[1,2]\"         \"[1,5]\"         \"[4]\"           \"[6]\"          \n[13] \"[1,2,3,4,5,6]\" \"[5,6]\"         \"[1,6]\"         \"[3,5]\"        \n[17] \"[4,5]\"         \"[2,6]\"         \"[2,4]\"         \"[2,5,6]\"      \n[21] \"[1,4]\"         \"[2,3]\"         \"[3,4,5,6]\"     \"[1,2,3,4]\"    \n[25] \"[1,3,5,6]\"     \"[1,3,5]\"       \"[2,3,4]\"       \"[3,5,6]\"      \n[29] \"[2,4,6]\"       \"[1,2,5]\"       \"[3,6]\"         \"[1,2,6]\"      \n[33] \"[1,4,6]\"       \"[2,3,5]\"       \"[1,3,4,6]\"     \"[1,2,3,4,5]\"  \n[37] \"[4,6]\"         \"[2,4,5]\"       \"[1,2,4]\"       \"[1,3,6]\"      \n[41] \"[1,2,3,4,6]\"   \"[3,4,5]\"       \"[1,2,3]\"       \"[1,3,4,5,6]\"  \n[45] \"[4,5,6]\"       \"[1,2,3,5]\"     \"[1,4,5]\"       \"[3,4]\"        \n[49] \"[2,3,4,5]\"     \"[1,4,5,6]\"     \"[1,2,5,6]\"     \"[1,3,4]\"      \n\n\n\n\n3.3 Manipulating variables that are coded as numeric variables\nMany variables in this dataset are coded as numeric values, but have specific categories linking up to the numbers. Using mutate() and cases() similar to our Data Management lesson, please create a new categorical variable with the specified categories from the codebook. Make sure that you create a variable with a new name! Since some of these variables are ordered categories, we will investigate if it’s appropriate to use the numeric or categorical version of the variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of how I would create new variable for self-perception of weight (iam_001):\n\n\n\nBy looking at the codebook, I see that respondents answer the following question: “Currently, I am:”\n\n“Very underweight”\n“Moderately underweight”\n“Slightly underweight”\n“Neither underweight nor underweight”\n“Slightly overweight”\n“Moderately overweight”\n“Very overweight”\n\nIf I look at the data as is, I see that the variable is numeric.\n\niat_2021 %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(iam_001) %&gt;%\n  tbl_summary()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      Characteristic\n      N = 465,8861\n    \n  \n  \n    iam_001\n\n        1\n2,023 (0.6%)\n        2\n7,902 (2.4%)\n        3\n24,399 (7.3%)\n        4\n148,081 (44%)\n        5\n88,566 (27%)\n        6\n43,090 (13%)\n        7\n18,978 (5.7%)\n        Unknown\n132,847\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      1 n (%)\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nAgain, I want to create a varaible with the answers instead of numbers, so I will change transform the variable to include the text:\n\niat_2021 = iat_2021 %&gt;%\n  mutate(iam_001_f = case_match(iam_001,\n                             7 ~ \"Very overweight\",\n                             6 ~ \"Moderately overweight\",\n                             5 ~ \"Slightly overweight\",\n                             4 ~ \"Neither underweight nor underweight\",\n                             3 ~ \"Slightly underweight\",\n                             2 ~ \"Moderately underweight\",\n                             1 ~ \"Very underweight\",\n                             .default = NA # to add NA if unknown\n                             ))\n\nI have called the new variable iam_001_f to indicate that the variable is not in factor form. You can also call it something like iam_001_cat to indicate the categorical form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nIdentify and list the variables that are coded numerically and correspond to categories. Create a new variable for the categorical/factor version of the variable. It is up to you to check that your code ran properly!! If you are using multi-choice categorical variables (might include race, gender), then do not convert the variable yet!\n\n\n\n\n3.4 Creating age from birth date and test date\nThis dataset does not have an available “age” variable. However, we have enough information to determine each individual’s age from the test date and their self-reported birth date. We can use the lubridate package to configure the age. First, we need to use make_date() to construct the birth date and test date. Below, I have implemented make_date() to make the birth date.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nFrom the codebook, find the variables that we can use to construct the test date. Then use make_date() to create the test date.\n\n\n\niat_2021 = iat_2021 %&gt;%\n  mutate(birthdate = make_date(month = birthmonth, year = birthyear), \n         testdate = make_date(month = month, year = year))\n\nOnce the two dates are created, we can use further use lubridate to calculate the age in years. This code is a little complicated, so here is an example of how I have created age:\n\niat_2021 = iat_2021 %&gt;%\n  mutate(age = interval(start = birthdate, end = testdate) %&gt;%\n          as.period() %&gt;% year()) %&gt;%\n  select(-birthmonth, -birthyear, -year, -month, \n         -testdate, -birthdate)\n\nNote that the name of my dataset is iat_2021 and I feed it into mutate(). Within mutate(), I assigned age to the interval between the name of my birth date (birthdate) and the name of my test date (testdate). I need to convert the interval to a period of time (as.period()), then to a measurement of years (year()).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nFollowing the above example, create an age variable that measures the years between individuals’ birth and test date. Then remove the variables used to make age.\n\n\n\n\n3.5 If you chose BMI, create the variable\nRaw data from weight and height are categorical. This is according to the codebook associated with this dataset. Please find your codebook file named Weight_IAT_public_2021_codebook.csv . You can find the value names for myweight_002 and myheight_002.\n\nFor example, in the weight variable,\n\nmost categories identify a lower limit to the weight in the group. One example group is weight is greater than or equal to 200 pounds and less than 205 pounds (labelled as “200 lb :: 91 kg”).\nthe first category for weight is “below 50lb:: 23kg” with 258 observations\nthe last category for weight is “above 440lb:: above 200kg” with 295 observations\n\nWhile the 5 groups of weight leading up the last category have 33, 28, 34, 20, and 89 observations, respectively.\n\n\n\nI will post an extra resource outlining some of my work on the BMI variable.\n\n\n3.6 Make a new dataset with only complete cases\nHandling missing data is outside the scope of our class. There are many techniques to handling missing data, but we will use complete case analysis. This means we will only use observations that have information for every variable we chose. The function drop_na() will give you the complete cases. You can feed your dataset into the function and assign it as a new dataframe.\nFor example:\n\nnew_df = old_df %&gt;% drop_na()\n\niat_2021 = iat_2021 %&gt;%\n    mutate(iam_001_f = case_match(iam_001,\n                                  7 ~ \"Very overweight\",\n                                  6 ~ \"Moderately overweight\",\n                                  5 ~ \"Slightly overweight\",\n                                  4 ~ \"Neither underweight nor underweight\",\n                                  3 ~ \"Slightly underweight\",\n                                  2 ~ \"Moderately underweight\",\n                                  1 ~ \"Very underweight\",\n                                  .default = NA) %&gt;% \n             factor(levels = c(\"Very underweight\", \n                               \"Moderately underweight\", \n                               \"Slightly underweight\", \n                               \"Neither underweight nor underweight\", \n                               \"Slightly overweight\", \n                               \"Moderately overweight\", \n                               \"Very overweight\")))\n\n\n\n\n4. Some exploratory data analysis\n\n4.1 Peek at your outcome\nThis serves as a check to make sure we are all looking at the correct outcome: IAT score.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nPlease plot a histogram of the IAT scores. What do you notice about the outcome?\n\n\n\n\n4.2 Univariate exploratory data analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nUsing ggplot or tables, visualize your variables. Get a sense of each variable’s distribution. Do you notice anything out of the ordinary?\n\n\n\n\n4.3 Bivariate exploratory data analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nTake a look at the scatterplot, violin, or box plot of IAT score and your variable of interest. Use R and ggplot to make this plot. If your variable of interest is categorical, then make sure to use a violin or boxplot.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Revisit your research question\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nPlease restate the research question that you proposed in Lab 1. What are your thoughts on the research question now that we looked at the data? Feel free to change it now that we’ve looked at the data. If you change your question, make sure 4.2 reflects the new research question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn research, we typically do NOT change our research question after looking at the data! Researchers typically form their questions from other research and their expertise. We may not have expertise in this field and we have not been studying implicit bias, so I want to be a little more flexible with our analysis."

    "section": "Question 1",
    "text": "Question 1\nThis homework assignment is based on data collected as part of an observational study of patients who suffered from stroke.\nDataset: The main goal was to study various psychological factors: optimism, fatalism, depression, spirituality, and their relationship with stroke severity and other health outcomes among the study participants. Data were collected using questionnaires during a baseline interview and also medical chart review. More information about this study can be found in the article Fatalism, optimism, spirituality, depressive symptoms and stroke outcome: a population based analysis.\nThe dataset that you will work with is called completedata.sas7bdat. It is SIMILAR but does not exactly match the data in the article. It contains information on complete cases (i.e. excludes participants who had missing data on one or more variables of interest) who suffered a stroke. The two variables we are interested in are:\n\nCovariate: Fatalism (larger values indicate that the individual feels less control of their life)\n\nScores range from 8 to 40\n\nOutcome: Depression (larger values imply increased depression)\n\nScores range from 0 to 27\n\n\nFor our homework purposes we will assume they are continuous.\n\nfatal_dep = read_sas(here(\"./homework/data/completedata.sas7bdat\"))\n\n\nPart a\nPlot the data, with title and axis labels, for Depression (y-axis) vs. Fatalism (x-axis). Comment on what you see.\n\n\nPart b\nFit a linear regression model to estimate the association between the predictor Fatalism and the outcome Depression.\nInterpret the slope and intercept. Does the intercept make sense?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMake sure to include the confidence interval. Whenever asked to interpret coefficients, you must include confidence intervals. Also, the “units” for fatalism and depression are scores.\n\n\n\n\nPart c\nIn your dataset, make a new variable FatalismC, equal to Fatalism centered at its median (C is for centered).\n\\[\n\\text{FatalismC} = \\text{Fatalism} - \\text{median of Fatalism}\n\\]\nThis is one way of centering a variable, and can be used when the intercept estimate does not make sense. (Hint: the mutate() function will work well here!)\nPlot the data, with title and axis labels, for Depression (y-axis) vs. FatalismC (x-axis).\n\n\nPart d\nRe-run the regression from Part b using this new variable for FatalismC. Interpret the new slope and intercept. Which of the following are the same as Part b: intercept, slope?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMake sure to include the confidence interval. Whenever asked to interpret coefficients, you must include confidence intervals. Also, the “units” for the centered fatalism is still the score.\n\n\n\n\nPart e\nFrom the above interpretations, what would be the equivalent conclusion from a hypothesis test for the association between Depression and Fatalism?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou do not need to go through the whole process for the hypothesis test. You only need to state whether it is rejected or not and site the confidence interval as evidence."

    "text": "Questions\n\nQuestion 1\nA high respiratory rate is a potential diagnostic indicator of respiratory infection in children. To judge whether a respiratory rate is “high” however, a physician must have a clear picture of the distribution of normal rates. To this end, Italian researchers measured the respiratory rates (in breaths/minute) of 618 children between the ages of 15 days and 3 years (measured in months).\nThe data and problem framing came from the Sleuth3 package. Please make sure to run the following code to load the data. You can directly access the dataset ex0824 from the package. I have included a new assignment of the data to q1_data if you would like to use that.\n\nif(!require(Sleuth3)) { install.packages(\"Sleuth3\"); library(Sleuth3) }\nq1_data = ex0824 \n\n\nPart a\nCreate a scatterplot of the dependent and independent variables with both the best-fit line and a smoothed curve through the points. Describe the relationship between the dependent and independent variables, and also comment on whether you think it is reasonable to use a linear regression to model the relationship.\n\n\nPart b\nWrite out the population regression model for the simple linear regression model. Please leave the variables untransformed for now.\n\n\nPart c\nFit the regression model, display the regression table, and write out the fitted regression line.\n\n\nPart d\nAssess the normality of the model’s fitted residuals by creating a histogram, density plot, and boxplot of the residuals to visually inspect the distribution of the residuals, and describe any deviations from normality.\n\n\nPart e\nAssess the normality of the model’s fitted residuals by creating QQ plot of the residuals.\nBonus work, but not required: Compare the QQ plot to 4 such plots simulated from normal data, and discuss why or why not the residuals could have come from a normal distribution.\n\n\nPart f\nTest the normality of the model’s fitted residuals and comment on whether the test’s conclusion is consistent with your visual inspection or not. Make sure to include the hypotheses, needed R code, and a conclusion to the test based on the p-value (as shown in these slides).\n\n\nPart g\nCreate a residual plot using ggplot and the residuals. Discuss what this means in the context of our model assumptions.\n\n\nPart h\nDetermine whether there are any observations with high leverage. Please use the cutoff, \\(h_i &gt; 6/n\\). If there are observations with high leverage, print the observations and state how many high leverage points there are.\n\n\nPart i\nPrint the 10 observations with highest Cook’s distance. If there are observations with high Cook’s distance (\\(d_i &gt;1\\)), state how many observations have high Cook’s distance.\n\n\nPart j\nCreate a histogram for rate. Describe its distribution shapes.\n\n\nPart k\nUsing the above histogram, and Tukey’s ladder of transformations, discuss the range of transformations that will be appropriate for Rate. Explain your reasoning.\nThen use gladder() to decide on two possible transformations. Explain your reasoning.\nNote: questions below will ask about model fit with the transformations. For now, just explain why you chose the two that you did.\n\n\nPart l\nAdd the two rate transformations you chose above to the dataset. You do not need to print any output, just make sure the code is visible.\n\n\nPart m\nCreate scatterplots using two transformed rates and age. Discuss if either transformation potentially improves the model fit. Explain why or why not. Note: including lines will help!\n\n\nPart n\nUsing one of the transoformed outcomes, fit the regression model, display the regression table, and write out the fitted regression line.\n\n\nPart o\nAssess the normality of the model’s fitted residuals by creating QQ plot of the residuals. Does the transformation improve the QQ plot?\n\n\nPart p\nCreate a residual plot using ggplot and the residuals. Discuss what this means in the context of our model assumptions. Does the transformation improve our model assumptions?\n\n\nPart q\nBetween the model with the untransformed outcome and the transformed outcome, which would you recommend using for analysis? (Hint: there are pros and cons to both models)\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\nThis question uses the same dataset as HW 2, question 1.\nThis question is based on data collected as part of an observational study of patients who suffered from stroke.\nDataset: The main goal was to study various psychological factors: optimism, fatalism, depression, spirituality, and their relationship with stroke severity and other health outcomes among the study participants. Data were collected using questionnaires during a baseline interview and also medical chart review. More information about this study can be found in the article Fatalism, optimism, spirituality, depressive symptoms and stroke outcome: a population based analysis.\nThe dataset that you will work with is called completedata.sas7bdat. The two variables we are interested in are:\n\nCovariate 1: Fatalism (larger values indicate that the individual feels less control of their life)\n\nPotential scores range from 8 to 40\n\nCovariate 2: Optimism (larger values indicate that the individual feels higher levels of optimism)\n\nPotential scores range from 6 to 24\n\nCovariate 3: Spirituality (larger values indicate that the individual has more belief in a higher power)\n\nPotential scores range from 2 to 8\n\nOutcome: Depression (larger values imply increased depression)\n\nPotential scores range from 0 to 27\n\n\nFor our homework purposes we will assume each variable is continuous.\n\ndep_df = read_sas(here(\"./homework/data/completedata.sas7bdat\"))\n\n\nPart a\nFit the regression model with all the covariates (Fatalism, Optimism, Spirituality), display the regression table, and write out the fitted regression line.\n\n\nPart b\nInterpret each coefficient (\\(\\beta_0\\), \\(\\beta_1\\), \\(\\beta_2\\), \\(\\beta_3\\)).\nDoes the intercept make sense for the range of values that each covariate can take? Explain.\n\n\nPart c\nRecall in Homework 2, we ran a simple linear regression model for Depression vs. Fatalism with the following interpretation for the coefficient: For every 1 point higher fatalism score, there is an expected difference of 0.25 points higher depression score (95%CI: 0.17, 0.32).\nDoes the addition of Optimism and Spirituality change our coefficient estimate for Fatalism? (No need for an official hypothesis test here. I just want us to note some differences.)\n\n\nPart d\nFrom the fitted regression model, calculate the regression line when Optimism score is 10 and Spirituality score is 6.\n\n\nPart e\nDoes at least one of the covariates contribute significantly to the prediction of Depression? (Note: this is an overall test. Please follow the hypothesis test steps. To complete step 4-6, simply output your ANOVA table.)\n\n\nPart f\nDoes the addition of Spirituality add significantly to the prediction of Depression achieved by Fatalism and Optimism?\n\n\nPart g\nDoes the addition of Spirituality and Optimism add significantly to the prediction of Depression achieved by Fatalism?"

There are a few issues with the self-reported BMI that immediately stuck out:\n\nComponents of BMI (weight and height) were self-reported\n\nPeople told they are underweight often add pounds (REFERENCE)\nPeople told they are overweight often subtract pounds (REFERENCE)\n\nRaw data from weight and height are categorical. This is according to the codebook associated with this dataset. Please find your codebook file named Weight_IAT_public_2021_codebook.csv . You can find the value names for myweight_002 and myheight_002.\nFor example, in the weight variable,\n\nmost categories identify a lower limit to the weight in the group. One example group is weight is greater than or equal to 200 pounds and less than 205 pounds (labelled as “200 lb :: 91 kg”).\nthe first category for weight is “below 50lb:: 23kg” with 258 observations\nthe last category for weight is “above 440lb:: above 200kg” with 295 observations\n\nWhile the 5 groups of weight leading up the last category have 33, 28, 34, 20, and 89 observations, respectively.\n\nMy intention here is not the question anyone’s weight, but keep in mind that surveys sometimes have people selecting the first or last option because they are not taking the survey seriously\n\n\n\nMy exact steps\n\nI wanted to get a table of the counts within each weight group. I used the gt package to make a table of what I thought was a categorical variable. It looks like R interprets the numbered categories as numbers.\n\niat_prep %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(myweight_002) %&gt;%\n  tbl_summary()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n      Characteristic\n      N = 465,8861\n    \n  \n  \n    myweight_002\n23 (18, 29)\n        Unknown\n141,326\n  \n\n  \n    \n      1 Median (IQR)\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nI will first check the class of the variable to make sure R is doing what I think it’s doing.\n\nclass(iat_prep$myweight_002)\n\n[1] \"integer\"\n\n\nSo R is interpreting the values as integers. I will need to make them categories to view them through gt commands.\nLet’s make it a category:\n\niat_prep2 = iat_prep %&gt;% \n  mutate(myweight = as.factor(myweight_002))\n\nNow we make the table:\n\niat_prep2 %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(myweight) %&gt;%\n  tbl_summary()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n      Characteristic\n      N = 465,8861\n    \n  \n  \n    myweight\n\n        1\n258 (&lt;0.1%)\n        2\n257 (&lt;0.1%)\n        3\n329 (0.1%)\n        4\n363 (0.1%)\n        5\n379 (0.1%)\n        6\n329 (0.1%)\n        7\n327 (0.1%)\n        8\n360 (0.1%)\n        9\n589 (0.2%)\n        10\n1,002 (0.3%)\n        11\n2,180 (0.7%)\n        12\n3,766 (1.2%)\n        13\n6,175 (1.9%)\n        14\n9,038 (2.8%)\n        15\n12,068 (3.7%)\n        16\n15,598 (4.8%)\n        17\n16,007 (4.9%)\n        18\n17,518 (5.4%)\n        19\n19,093 (5.9%)\n        20\n17,794 (5.5%)\n        21\n15,599 (4.8%)\n        22\n16,636 (5.1%)\n        23\n14,854 (4.6%)\n        24\n14,643 (4.5%)\n        25\n13,510 (4.2%)\n        26\n12,778 (3.9%)\n        27\n12,243 (3.8%)\n        28\n11,498 (3.5%)\n        29\n9,414 (2.9%)\n        30\n9,099 (2.8%)\n        31\n7,274 (2.2%)\n        32\n8,775 (2.7%)\n        33\n4,691 (1.4%)\n        34\n5,411 (1.7%)\n        35\n4,595 (1.4%)\n        36\n5,659 (1.7%)\n        37\n3,494 (1.1%)\n        38\n3,938 (1.2%)\n        39\n2,489 (0.8%)\n        40\n2,932 (0.9%)\n        41\n1,941 (0.6%)\n        42\n3,197 (1.0%)\n        43\n1,244 (0.4%)\n        44\n1,794 (0.6%)\n        45\n1,442 (0.4%)\n        46\n1,322 (0.4%)\n        47\n1,251 (0.4%)\n        48\n1,238 (0.4%)\n        49\n900 (0.3%)\n        50\n800 (0.2%)\n        51\n651 (0.2%)\n        52\n1,152 (0.4%)\n        53\n347 (0.1%)\n        54\n436 (0.1%)\n        55\n346 (0.1%)\n        56\n409 (0.1%)\n        57\n295 (&lt;0.1%)\n        58\n384 (0.1%)\n        59\n165 (&lt;0.1%)\n        60\n202 (&lt;0.1%)\n        61\n126 (&lt;0.1%)\n        62\n342 (0.1%)\n        63\n92 (&lt;0.1%)\n        64\n154 (&lt;0.1%)\n        65\n129 (&lt;0.1%)\n        66\n113 (&lt;0.1%)\n        67\n139 (&lt;0.1%)\n        68\n85 (&lt;0.1%)\n        69\n85 (&lt;0.1%)\n        70\n55 (&lt;0.1%)\n        71\n65 (&lt;0.1%)\n        72\n120 (&lt;0.1%)\n        73\n26 (&lt;0.1%)\n        74\n26 (&lt;0.1%)\n        75\n26 (&lt;0.1%)\n        76\n33 (&lt;0.1%)\n        77\n28 (&lt;0.1%)\n        78\n34 (&lt;0.1%)\n        79\n20 (&lt;0.1%)\n        80\n89 (&lt;0.1%)\n        81\n295 (&lt;0.1%)\n        Unknown\n141,326\n  \n\n  \n    \n      1 n (%)\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nThe table is really long, so a histogram would work much better to visualize how many observations are in each category:\n\nggplot(data = iat_prep, aes(x = myweight_002)) + \n  geom_histogram() +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(iat_prep$myweight_002, \n                                   na.rm = T)), \n             color = \"red\", linewidth = 2)\n\nWarning: Use of `iat_prep$myweight_002` is discouraged.\nℹ Use `myweight_002` instead.\n\n\nWarning: Removed 141326 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_bin()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe need to convert the heights and weights to their cm and kg respectively.

Three more points to find the conversion: 10:90lb; 20:140lb; and 30: 190lb.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nlb & = m\\times cat+b \\\\\n90 &= m \\times 10 + b \\\\\nb & = 90-10m \\\\\n\\\\\n140 &= 20m + b \\\\\n140 &= 20m + (90-10m) \\\\\nm &=5 \\\\\nb&=90-10m = 90-50=40 \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThen we double check with third set of points:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n190 & = 5 \\times 30 + 40 \\\\\n190 & = 190 \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\niat_prep$myweight_lb = 5*iat_prep$myweight_002 + 40\n\nThen we need to convert height to meters since BMI is in \\(kg/m^2\\).\n\niat_prep$myweight_kg = 0.453592*iat_prep$myweight_lb\n\n\niat_prep$bmi = iat_prep$myweight_kg/(iat_prep$myheight_m)^2\n\n\nggplot(data = iat_prep, aes(x = bmi)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(bmi, \n                                   na.rm = T)), \n             color = \"red\", linewidth = 2)\n\nWarning: Removed 142470 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_bin()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom histogram, looks like there are a couple observations at BMIs greater than 200.

    "text": "2 Lab activities\nBefore starting this lab, you should go back to Lab 2, save a new .rda file that contains all the new variables from that Lab. Then you can load it here!\n\n2.1 Restate your research question\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nPlease restate your research question below using the provided format. It’s repetitive, but it helps me contextualize my feedback as I look through your lab.\n\n\nHow is implicit anti-fat bias, as measured by the IAT score, associated with “insert main independent variable here”?\n\n\n2.2 Quality Control\nThere are a few more issues with the data that we need to look into. First, there is another coding for NA values in the race variable: -999. We will need to filter out these observations.\nWe will also need to look at individuals who have potentially answered the survey questions untruthfully. We cannot catch everything, but a good place to start is by looking at individuals who have done more than one of the following:\n\nselected the earliest or latest possible birth year\nselected the lowest or highest possible education\nselected all gender identities (for those using gender identity)\nselected all races (for those using multiple selection race)\nselected the lowest or highest weight (for those looking at BMI)\nselected the lowest or highest height (for those looking at BMI)\n\nI want to take a second to mention that any of the above selections, and combinations of the above selections, are valid. However, we should start to flag the possibility that someone has not gone through the survey properly if we notice that most or all of the respondent’s answers are the first answer choice, last answer choice, or selected all options. Additionally, not all of these carry the same importance in discerning validity. For example, a recorded age of 111 years old is the most striking to me. When paired with other selections that are the maximum or minimum (or first or last) option, then I will record it for future investigation. If this observation looks to be an outlier or high leverage point in our analysis, that is when I’ll decide to remove it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTasks\n\n\n\n\nFilter out observations with a value of -999 in the race variable.\nGlimpse at the observations that may indicate a respondent who has not properly completed the survey portion. This will require filtering for specific answer choices. Please see examples of filter() on it’s documentation page.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Working with multi-selection variables\nIn the list of variables that we may choose to work with (in Lab 2), there are two that allowed respondents to select multiple categories. The two variables are genderIdentitiy and raceombmulti. If you did not choose these variables to work with, you may skip this section.\nIf you chose one or both of these variables, then we need to make new variables that correspond to indicators for each possible selection in the respective variable.\nLet’s start with the grepl function. For this function, we can input one of our column names and a value, then it will output, for each row, if the value is in the column. For example, in genderIdentity an individual may identify as a “Trans female/Trans woman” and “Gender queer/Gender nonconforming.” In our dataset in R, this would show as [4,5] in genderIdentity. If we want to create two separate indicators for anyone who identifies as “Trans female/Trans woman” then I need to look for the value 4 in the column genderIdentity. I will run a separate indicator to find individuals who identify as “Gender queer/Gender nonconforming.” Here is an example code of how I would use grepl to do this:\n\niat_prep_new = iat_prep_old %&gt;%\n  mutate(ind_tf_tw = grepl(4, genderIdentity), \n         ind_gq_gnc = grepl(5, genderIdentity))\n\nYou will need to extend this to all other gender identities.\nFor race, raceombmulti is also the follow up question to raceomb_002. So our indicators need to reflect both variables. In this case, we need to use grepl on both columns at once. For example, if I want to create an indicator for individuals who identify as American Indian/Alaskan Native then I need to find individuals who identify as American Indian/Alaskan Native only and individuals who identify as American Indian/Alaskan Native in addition to another race. For example, my code might look like:\n\niat_prep_new = iat_prep_old %&gt;%\n  mutate(ind_AIAN = grepl(1, raceomb_002) | grepl(1, raceombmulti))\n\nI suggest only searching for 1-7 in both raceomb_002 and raceombmulti. Note that if raceomb_002 = 8 , then individuals identified as “multiracial” and will select values in raceombmulti.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nIf you are using genderIdentity or raceombmulti, create indicator variables for each possible selection.\n\n\n\n\n2.4 Thinking about potential confounders and effect modifiers\nBefore we explore more of the data, I want us to take a second to think through potential confounders and effect modifiers from the covariates that we selected in Lab 2. For some of the covariates, we were asked to explain why we chose them. Now I want you to consider how each could alter the relationship between IAT score and your variable of interest (from your research question). For each covariate, explain how it might or might not change the relationship. For example, if our variable of interest is fat group identity, then we may consider that self-perception of size is a confounder since it could be linked with fat group identity and potentially be associated with IAT score. For multi-level, unordered categorical covariates, you might consider if a specific category has an impact. For example, we might consider creating an indicator for white, non-Hispanic/Lantinx respondents since the history of fatphobia is tied with white-centered colonization and white supremacy (Redpath, 2023). Thus IAT scores might look different for white respondents vs. minority respondents (those who answered American Indian/Alaskan Natives; East Asian; South Asian; Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander; Black or African American; or Hispanic or Latino).\nThe purpose of this section is to make sure we are thinking about the relationships between variables in our analysis. I do not want us to make any decisions based solely on the data. I want any changes or manipulations in our variables to be motivated by research-backed evidence.\nFinally, for this project, we are most interested in the relationship we identified in our research question! Other variables are supporting this question, and improving that model fit so that we get as close to the true relationship in our research question as possible!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nFor each variable, consider how each could alter the relationship between IAT score and your variable of interest (from your research question). For each covariate, explain how it might or might not change the relationship.\n\n\n\n\n2.5 Continuing data exploration\nIn this section, we are going to further explore the variables that we might be adjusting for in our model (potential covariates outside the variable or interest in our research question).\n\n2.5.1 Bivariate exploration\nWe want to look at all other relationships between IAT score and each covariate (outside of the research question variable). Some of you have already made these plots in Lab 2, so you can simply refine them and display them here. There are a few questions that I want you to consider:\n\nFor categorical variables, is there an inherent order? Does the ordered values follow an approximately linear relationship? Are the categories “evenly spaced”? For example, education categories are not necessarily evenly spaced.\nAgain for categorical variables, is there a natural place to divide the categories up? For example, in education, it might be helpful to control for the fact that students in college might be asked to complete this test as an assignment. Thus, we might make an indicator for individuals in college vs. not. This decision can be informed by our plot, but it should not be driven by our plot!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nFor each variable outside of your research question, create the appropriate plot to visualize the relationship between IAT score and the variable. Comment if there is an obvious trend or not.\n\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Multivariate exploration\nNow we want to extend our plots for Lab 2 where we looked at the outcome (IAT score) and our main variable of interest (as identified by our research question). Here, we will run the same plot, but include another variable. This will help us visualize potential confounders or effect modifiers. Note that if you made indicator variables (for race, gender identity or any other variable), then you should have a plot for each indicator variable.\nYou will need to really think about what kind of plot will best displays these relationships! IAT score is continuous, and many of your variable of interest is categorical. You may consider side-by-side boxplots where the color is the additional variable. You might also consider a jitter plot or only plotting the means. Remember you’re goal for plotting is to get a sense of the relationship only from the plot! Your audience should not have to work hard to understand what the plot is communicating. For example, I wanted to look at IAT score, internalization of societal standards, and race. I might make my plot like such:\n\n\nCode to contruct multivariate plot\nggplot(iat_prep2, aes(x = important_001, y=IAT_score, color = as.factor(raceomb_002_f))) +\n  # geom_jitter(size = 2, alpha = .6, width = 0.2) +\n  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = \"point\", size = 3, shape = 18) +\n  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom=\"line\") +\n  scale_x_discrete(limits = levels(iat_prep2$important_001_f)) +\n  labs(x = \"Importance of weight to sense of self\", \n       y = \"IAT score\",\n       title = \"Mean IAT scores for importance of weight to sense of self by race\", \n       color = \"Race\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, size = 8, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the above plot is specific for these variables!! Other variables may require a different type of visualization!! Also note that I originally had geom_jitter() in my plot, which would make the plot really hard to understand!! Try uncommenting it to see what I mean by “hard to understand.” Also, think about why I connected the mean IAT scores across the different levels of internalization. I had a hard time connecting specific race’s points to identify a trend. Again, try commenting out stat_summary(fun = mean, geom=\"line\") to see what I mean.\nPlease make sure that you have made the needed changes to your plot in Lab 2. I noticed many unordered groups in plots where there should be an inherent order and unreadable axes because the text was not tilted. Please see discussion on Slack for what some students did to achieve these plots.\nHere are a few sources that might help you get started with the visualizations:\n\nIntro to R\nModern Data Visualization with R\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nFor at least 3 variables outside of your research question, create the appropriate plot to visualize the relationship between IAT score, your main variable (in research question), and the variable outside your research question. Comment whether you can determine anything from the plot or not. If you can, is there any indication that the variable is a confounder or effect modifier?\n\n\n\n\n\n2.6 Fit a simple linear regression\nAs a starting point, it is good to fit a simple linear regression for our primary research question. This is often called the “crude” association. It just means that we are not adjusting for any other variables, and establishing the “starting point” for our analysis. It is likely that the results of the regression will change as we add other variables in the model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nRun a simple linear regression model for the relationship in your primary research question. Print the regression table. Interpret the results and comment on the initial trend you see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBonus Task\n\n\n\nThis is not required in Lab 3. However, if you want to run a multiple linear regression model with one other variable that you plotted in Multivariate Exploration, then you should try it! Do the results align with your ideas in Section 2.4 and/or the visualization you saw in Section 2.5?"

We will look at the association between flipper length of penguins (measured in mm) and specific species of penguins.\nDescription from help file:\n\nIncludes measurements for penguin species, island in Palmer Archipelago, size (flipper length, body mass, bill dimensions), and sex.\n\nMore info about the data.\n\n# first install the palmerpenguins package\n# install.packages(\"palmerpenguins\")\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\ndata(penguins)\n\n# run the command below to learn more about the variables in the penguins dataset\n# ?penguins\n\n\nPart a\nCalculate the average flipper lengths stratified by each of the penguin species.\n\n\nPart b\nMake a scatterplot (with jigger) of flipper lengths by species, and include diamond-shape points for the averages of the flipper lengths for each of the species.\n\n\nPart c\nWrite out the fitted regression equation that models the flipper length by penguin species. Use LaTeX math markup or insert an image of your equation. Do not yet insert values for the regression coefficients, i.e. use the generic coefficients \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_0, \\widehat{\\beta}_1\\). Use Adelie as the reference level.\n\n\nPart d\nRun the linear regression of flipper lengths vs. species in R, and display the regression table output. Which species did R choose as the reference level, and how did you determine this?\n\n\nPart e\nHow do we interpret each of the regression coefficients for this model? Write out a separate interpretation for each of the coefficients.\n\n\nPart f\nCalculate the mean flipper length (and the 95% CI) of penguins in the Chinstrap and Gentoo species using the predict() function.\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\nA team of nutrition experts investigated the influence of protein content in diet on the relationship between age (explanatory variable) and height (outcome, in centimeters) for children. Using the dataset, CH12Q03.xls, answer the following questions.\nThis question was adapted from this textbook.\n\nPart a\nUsing R, make a variable that is a factor for Diet. Make sure to check what values the original variable for Diet can take. How many indicator functions do you need to represent the categorical variable Diet (protein-rich vs. protein-poor)?\n\n\nPart b\nAt a level of significance \\(\\alpha = 0.10\\), test whether protein diet modifies the effect of age on height. Justify your answer (e.g., perform a hypothesis test for the interaction between diet and age).\nNote: recall that an effect modifier is an interaction.\n\n\nPart c\nIs it possible that diet is a confounder? Note: this will depend on your results from Part b.\n\n\nPart d\nWrite the fitted regression equation for our model in Part b. Write the respective regression lines for each specific diet group: protein rich and protein poor. Interpret the slope of each regression line (no need for a 95% CI here).\n\n\n\nQuestion 3\nAn experiment was conducted regarding a quantitative analysis of factors found in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in a sample of human blood serum. Three variables thought to be predictive of, or associated with, HDL measurement (Y) were the total cholesterol (X1) and total triglyceride (X2) concentrations in the sample, plus the presence or absence of a certain sticky component of the serum called sinking pre-beta or SPB (X3), coded as 0 if absent and 1 if present. Using the dataset, CH09Q05.xls, answer the following questions.\n\nPart a\nUse \\(\\alpha= 0.05\\), test whether if there is a crude association between HDL measurement and total cholesterol. Note: testing for a crude association means we fit a simple linear regression model and see if the association is significant.\n\n\nPart b\nSometimes simple linear regression leads us to believe that there is no association between two variables, but missing interaction might be obscuring the association. Use \\(\\alpha= 0.1\\) to test whether total triglyceride is an effect modifier of the association between HDL and total cholesterol.\nNote: Since the data frame has the variables named as \\(Y\\), \\(X1\\), and \\(X2\\), you may use those in the regression equations, but when you are making a conclusion, please use the specific names of the variables to identify each. For example, \\(Y\\) is actually HDL.\nNote: The plan is to cover interactions between two continuous covariates on Wednesday 2/21. We will not interpret the interaction coefficient for this, but we can test the interaction coefficient. Similar to the interaction for a binary covariate and a continuous covariate, we only need to test one coefficient, \\(\\beta_3\\).\n\n\nPart c\nIs it possible that total triglyceride is a confounder? No need to test this explicity.\nNote: this will depend on your results from Part b."

However, we should start to flag the possibility that someone has not gone through the survey properly if we notice that most or all of the respondent’s answers are the first answer choice, last answer choice, or selected all options. Additionally, not all of these carry the same importance in discerning validity. For example, a recorded age of 111 years old is the most striking to me. When paired with other selections that are the maximum or minimum (or first or last) option, then I will record it for future investigation.

    "text": "2.3 Working with multi-selection variables\nIn the list of variables that we may choose to work with (in Lab 2), there are two that allowed respondents to select multiple categories. The two variables are genderIdentitiy and raceombmulti. If you did not choose these variables to work with, you may skip this section.\nIf you chose one or both of these variables, then we need to make new variables that correspond to indicators for each possible selection in the respective variable.\nLet’s start with the grepl function. For this function, we can input one of our column names and a value, then it will output, for each row, if the value is in the column. For example, in genderIdentity an individual may identify as a “Trans female/Trans woman” and “Gender queer/Gender nonconforming.” In our dataset in R, this would show as [4,5] in genderIdentity. If we want to create two separate indicators for anyone who identifies as “Trans female/Trans woman” then I need to look for the value 4 in the column genderIdentity. I will run a separate indicator to find individuals who identify as “Gender queer/Gender nonconforming.” Here is an example code of how I would use grepl to do this:\n\niat_prep_new = iat_prep_old %&gt;%\n  mutate(ind_tf_tw = grepl(4, genderIdentity), \n         ind_gq_gnc = grepl(5, genderIdentity))\n\nYou will need to extend this to all other gender identities.\nFor race, raceombmulti is also the follow up question to raceomb_002. So our indicators need to reflect both variables. In this case, we need to use grepl on both columns at once. For example, if I want to create an indicator for individuals who identify as American Indian/Alaskan Native then I need to find individuals who identify as American Indian/Alaskan Native only and individuals who identify as American Indian/Alaskan Native in addition to another race. For example, my code might look like:\n\niat_prep_new = iat_prep_old %&gt;%\n  mutate(ind_AIAN = grepl(1, raceomb_002) | grepl(1, raceombmulti))\n\nI suggest only searching for 1-7 in both raceomb_002 and raceombmulti. Note that if raceomb_002 = 8 , then individuals identified as “multiracial” and will select values in raceombmulti.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask for 1.2\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using genderIdentity or raceombmulti, create indicator variables for each possible selection."

Comment if there is an obvious trend or not.\n\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Multivariate exploration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nFor at least 3 variables outside of your research question, create the appropriate plot to visualize the relationship between IAT score, your main variable (in research question), and the variable outside your research question. Comment whether you can determine anything from the plot or not. If you can, is there any indication that the variable is a confounder or effect modifier?\n\n\n\n\n\n2.6 Fit a simple linear regression\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nRun a simple linear regression model for the relationship in your primary research question. Print the regression table. Interpret the results and comment on the initial trend you see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBonus Task\n\n\n\nThis is not required in Lab 3. However, if you want to run a multiple linear regression model with one other variable that you plotted in Multivariate Exploration, then you should try it! Do the results align with your ideas in Section 2.4 and/or the visualization you saw in Section 2.5?"
