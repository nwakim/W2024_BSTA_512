    "text": "Online Resources\n\nSlack\nWe will use Slack as our main form of communication for the class. I will try to mirror the Slack Workspace that you had for 512/612. If you are unsure how to do a homework problem or have other questions, please ask myself or the TA’s either by email or posting your question(s) on Slack. Please know that Slack is not guarded by the OSHU firewall, so if you have a question about accommodations or any sensitive topics, you may wish to message me via email. You can still message me regarding sensitive information on Slack, but I will not initiate those conversations on Slack. Please continue to use the tips on asking for help that Meike laid out in the 512/612 syllabus. I will also add her tips to the Slack workspace.\n**Please use this invitation link for our Slack workspace!**\n\n\nSakai\nCourse materials will be delivered online through Sakai, OHSU’s course management system. This is where you’ll find all course materials (syllabus, videos, lectures, homework assignments, announcements, etc.). This is also where you’ll submit all course assignments.\nI will try to keep the structure of the Sakai page similar to that of BSTA 512/612. It’s always tough for you, the students, to spend two quarters with one faculty member then change to a new one. That is why I will try my best to keep the Sakai navigation similar. However, certain aspects will certainly be different. I hope we can work together to identify the things that are and are not working for our classroom. \n\n\nExplain Everything\nI plan to use Explain Everything on my iPad to deliver lectures. This application allows me to take real time notes, access Poll Everywhere, and record the lecture. I hope to use these features to allow you to follow me during lecture and have access to a recording for asynchronous viewing. While I will try to always make a recorded lecture available to you after class, I want you to try to attend class in person. I understand that life events get in the way on in-person attendance, but your attendance in-person brings me joy while I teach, and then further motivates me to be a great teacher. \nNote: I am new to this application so I ask you for some grace as I learn to navigate it. \n\n\nWebex\nWebex software will be used for office hours. To give everyone the best possible experience with Webex, we recommend the following best practices:\n\nPlease stay muted until you want to participate\nDuring office hours, please send a message in chat with your question or with a statement like “I have a question.” This makes sure I or the TA can address everyone’s questions in order. \nI encourage you to attend office hours with your video on. This helps me recognize you, and keep mental notes on what techniques/concepts I emphasize to facilitate your specific understanding. \n\n\n\nPoll Everywhere\nWe will use the Poll Everywhere tool as an interactive feature of the course. Poll Everywhere is a web-based application that allows students to participate by responding via text messages or by visiting a web page on an internet-enabled device (smartphone, tablet, laptop). Instructions will be displayed on-screen. The poll that is embedded within the presentation will update in real time. While there is no cost to use this software, standard text messaging rates will apply if you use your phone. Please make sure that you have a Poll Everywhere account before our first class. You are not required to use your OHSU/PSU email to make an account. \nDuring lectures I will pose questions to the class. These questions are designed to provide real-time feedback to both students and the instructor on how well students are grasping the material. This is meant to be an interactive, learning activity with NO contribution to your grade. Your identity will never be connected to your answers, so I encourage you to answer honestly.\n\n\nPennState STAT 414 Website\nPennState has a class offered to advanced undergraduates that has some overlap with our class. They have all their course notes posted on thispage. This is a great source if you would like to see class notes with different phrasing.\nNot all of our topics are covered in their notes, but the most important ones are. If you are having trouble finding our course’s concepts on their page, please make ask me at Office Hours, after class, or in a private meeting. I do not explicitly state corresponding sections under our schedule because I believe it is important for you to develop skills involving resources and learning key words that can help you find answers. \n\n\nR: Statistical Computing Software\nStudents will use statistical software to complete homework assignments. Students are required to use R/RStudio for this course. R can be freely downloaded. Helpful documentation on installing R is available. I encourage you to install R prior to attending our first lecture. Please email me if you need help installing R or RStudio.\nYou will need to download the following three things:\n\nR https://www.r-project.org/\nRstudio https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\nQuarto https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/\n\n\nAdditional R Resources\nYour learning and practicing of R will hopefully not be limited to this course. One of the best aspects of programming in R is that many resources are freely available online. Here are just a few additional resources you may explore beyond this class to continue your training in R.\n\n\nUseful online R resources\n\nR for the rest of us\nStatistical tools for high-throughput data analysis. ggplot2 essentials\nR-bloggers\nStack Overflow for troubleshooting\nR Graphical Manual\nQuick-R.

    "text": "Types of assessments\nThis class will use a combination of formative and summative assessments to build and test our knowledge. Below I define each of these types of assessments:\n\nFormative assessment: Activity or work meant to help students learn and practice. Grading of these assessments are meant to help the instructor and student identify gaps in knowledge and highlight accomplishments.\nSummative assessment: Work meant to test how well students have achieved learning objectives. Grading of these assessments are meant to gauge how well a student grasps the learning objectives and will be able to use their knowledge outside of the classroom.\n\nStudents will always have the opportunity to redo formative assessments until they are satisfied with their grade. That means students can redo homework and readings until they are satisfied with their grade. This is meant to emphasize the learning process, and reduce pressure for correctness. However, there are some limitations on “redoing” your work. In the homework grading scale (shown in Criteria), you might notice that certain grades correspond to a certain percentage of the homework completed. You can only redo problems that you have completely worked through. Thus, you can only increase your grade by increasing the amount of correct problems."

This class may not be a priority to you, you may be taking several other courses, or you may need to dedicate time to other activities. Homeworks are formative assessments, meaning its purpose is to help you learn and practice. To reduce the pressure on you to have perfect or complete homework, I have a very simple grading policy: Your homework will be given a check mark if you turn something in (whether it is incomplete, complete, correct, or wrong). I highly encourage you to stay up-to-date with the homeworks and put in as much effort as you can. This will be the most helpful work in this class!\nAfter the due date, either the TA or myself will post the solutions.\n\n\nViewing Grades in Sakai\nPoints you receive for graded activities will be posted to the Sakai Gradebook. Click on the Gradebook link on the left navigation to view your points.\n\n\nLate Work Policy\nI encourage you to make your best effort to submit all assignments on time, but I understand circumstances arise that are beyond our control. Please see this Swansea University’s page on extenuating circumstances for some examples. Not all circumstances are covered here, so please reach out if you have questions. \n\nEach of you will receive one “no questions asked” extension on any homework assignment. To request the extension, you can write an email with subject “Extension on Homework Assignment __” with body saying “I would like an extension on Homework Assignment __ for __ days.” I will grant you that extension with no questions asked.\n\nIf you have already used a “no questions asked” extension on homework, then homework grades will go down one point for every day it is late. For example, if your work is on par of a 5/5, but you turn it in homework 2 days late, then you will receive a 3/5. \n\nThe class will end on June 16, 2023. All coursework is expected to be completed by then. If you have extenuating circumstances, and need additional time to complete class assignments, please contact me. Together, we will come up with a plan for completion and to sort out registrar logistics.\nIf you have extenuating circumstances that may jeopardize your ability to do work for several weeks, please contact me. We will come up with a plan to keep you on track in the course and prevent any delay in your education.\nFor non-homework assignments, I ask you to email me directly. You can explain your circumstances and may ask me for an extension, but I won’t necessarily grant one.\nIf you have a emergency involving your self, family, pet, friend, classmate, or anything/one deemed important to you, please do not worry about immediately contacting me. We can work something out after your emergency. If I contact you during an emergency, it is only because I am worried, and you do NOT need to respond until you are able. \n\n\n\nRegrade Policy\nIf you think a question was incorrectly graded, first compare your answer to the answer key. If you believe a re-grade would be appropriate, write an email to me containing the question and a short explanation as to why the question(s) was/were incorrectly graded. Deadline: One week after assignments were returned to class (late requests will not be considered).\n\n\nAttendance Policy\nYou are expected to attend class and participate in class polls and the exit ticket. For students who miss class or need a review, I will make video and audio recordings of lectures available. There are no guarantees against technical or other challenges for the recording availability or quality. For students who are unable to attend the class in-person and synchronously, viewing the recording within 7 days is acceptable. Make sure to complete the exit ticket to demonstrate attendance."

    "title": "Outcomes, Events, and Sample Space",
    "section": "1.1 Introduction",
    "text": "1.1 Introduction\nThe introduction in this chapter starts with the following quote:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Probability theory is the study of randomness and all things associated with randomness.”\n\n\n\nI couldn’t say it better myself. There are examples with obvious hints at randomness (i.e. dice rolls, coins flips) and there are examples with not-so-obvious randomness involved (i.e. time until any given traffic light turns green).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 1.1\n\n\n\nWhen something happens at random there are several potential outcomes. Exactly one of the outcomes occurs. An event is defined to be a collection of some outcomes.\n\n\nOur goal in probability and statistics is to characterize randomness. Then as statisticians, we can use what we know about randomness to see if certain features of the world is within randomness or outside the randomness. For example, according to a New York Times article published on July 25, 2023, the Education Department is investigating Harvard University’s legacy admissions policy. Here is an excerpt from that article:\n\nHarvard gives preference to applicants who are recruited athletes, legacies, relatives of donors and children of faculty and staff. As a group, they make up less than 5 percent of applicants, but around 30 percent of those admitted each year. About 67.8 percent of these applicants are white, according to court papers.\n\nUsing probability, we can start to see why this practice might be inequitable. If these applicants make up 5% of the total applicant pool, and we completely, randomly chose applicants to admit, then we would expect 5% of admitted students to be this group of recruited athletes, legacies, relatives of donors, and children of faculty and staff. We could argue that recruited athletes are more likely to be admitted since they are, in fact, recruited, or that children of faculty and staff might “game” high school succesfully because they live in a home that subscribes to the academic world. If we want to compare the acceptance rate of 30% for this group to the average acceptance rate, the article actually fails to present a crucial peice of information: the average acceptance rate. I looked it up, and it is ~4%. So now we can start to think about questions like: With an average acceptance rate of 4%, does an acceptance of 30% of this group of recruited athletes, legacies, relatives of donors and children of faculty and staff make sense? We will explore this example further as we progress through our class.\nBaaack to our definitions: When we have several potential outcomes, and an event is a collection of outcomes, then we can start thinking of the set of potential outcomes. When there are no outcomes, then we have the empty set \\(\\emptyset\\). When we look at all outcomes, we call it the sample space \\(S\\). For now, when we look at a single event, we will focus on the sample space. When we start thinking of multiple events, the empty set might come into play. And just to reiterate: The empty set is an event. It is an impossible event, but it is still considered an event. So when you consider all possible events, the empty set is included. When you consider all possible outcomes, this is the sample space.\nNow let’s look at at an example with an obvious hint at randomness:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1.2\n\n\n\nYou roll a 6-sided die.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1.2 Explanation\n\n\n\n\n\nA 6-sided die has sides labelled 1-6. Thus, the sample space is \\(S=\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\) since we can land on any of the 6 sides. For every roll, only one of these outcomes occur, and that outcome is random.\nAn event can be any subgroup (more formally, subset) of the sample space, but not necessarily. Events can technically be outside of the sample space, but we often only consider events within the sample space.\nIf we can say our event is if we roll a 6, then our event is defined mathematically as \\(\\{6\\}\\). We can define a different event as rolling an odd numbered side, then our event is defined mathematically as \\(\\{1,3,5\\}\\). See TB pg 4 for more event examples.\n\n\n\nWe introduced subset, but here’s the definition:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 1.3\n\n\n\nEvent A is a subset of event B, written \\(A \\subset B\\). if every outcome in A is also an outcome in B.\n\n\n\nLet’s work on defining different types of events within sample spaces:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1.4\n\n\n\nA student buys a book and opens it to a random page. They note the number of typographical errors on the page. Let’s define the sample space and discuss one potential event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1.4 Explanation\n\n\n\n\n\nSince there must be 0 or more errors, and errors are counted with whole numbers, the sample space will be the set of nonnegative integers: \\(S=\\mathbb{Z}^{&gt;=0}\\). More plainly, \\(S=\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...\\}\\).\nHere are a few possible events we can consider: (I invite you to think of others if you’d like)\n\nevent that a page contains 4 errors\nevent that a page contains at most 3 errors\nevent that a page contains more than 3 errors\nevent that a page contains an odd number of errors.\n\n\n\n\nDefinitions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 1.11\n\n\n\nThe union of events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), denoted by \\(A \\cup B\\), contains all outcomes that are in \\(A\\) or \\(B\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 1.12\n\n\n\nThe intersection of events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), denoted by \\(A \\cap B\\), contains all outcomes that are both in \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)."

    "text": "Notes\nThere are a few things I’d like to address from the book:\n\nThere is a set of examples, 1.5 and 1.6, that talk about the birth of a baby. While this example is helpful for considering potential sample spaces, there is an oversight on the biology of births. The examples refer to the event of the sex assigned at birth (SAB). There are two issues in this example. First, SAB is considered binary in this example (I will get back to this). Second, the binary SAB is written as “boy” or “girl.” These labels have gender identity inherently attached to their meaning, and thus, the more accurate binary versions of these are “male” or “female,” respectively (“Assigned Sex at Birth,” n.d.). These are often denoted as “assigned male at birth” (AMAB) or “assigned female at birth” (AFAB). Going back the first issue, a binary representation of SAB does not cover all possible events. People can also be intersex, meaning their genitals, chromosomes, and/or reproductive organs are not exclusively AMAB or AFAB (“Intersex: What Is Intersex, Gender Identity, Intersex Surgery,” n.d.).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtension to Example 1.5 and 1.6\n\n\n\nYou can go back to these examples (TB pg. 5) and work through them with the more accurate representation of sex at birth. Please use the possible outcomes of AFAB, AMAB, or intersex."

    "text": "Muddiest Points\n\n1. Why is the number of possible events \\(2^{|S|}\\)?\nIn class, we were wondering why/if \\(2^{|S|}\\) is the general formula for calculating the total number of possible events. We were specifically wondering if the \\(2\\) came from the fact that we had two options (heads and tails) for our outcome. Let’s work through the example of a 6-sided die to explain this further. The sample space is \\(S=\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\). So is the total number of possible events \\(2^6\\) or \\(6^6\\) or something else? We can actually think about an event by using an indicator variable for each outcome of the sample space. An indicator variable is just a way to give us a yes/no answer to a question. So in this case, we are wondering: is this outcome a part of our event? If our event is \\(\\{1\\}\\) then for the outcome \\(1\\), the answer is “yes, the outcome is part of the event. For outcomes \\(2-6\\), the answer is”no, the outcome is not apart of the event.”\n\nFor each outcome, we have a “yes” or “no” answer. We can look at another example of an event. Let’s say our event is rolling an even number:\n\nFor \\(2\\), \\(4\\), and \\(6\\), the answer is “yes.” We can define the indicator variable for whether an outcome is in an event or not. The indicator gives a 1 or 0 for yes and no respectively.\n\nAs stated above, the \\(2\\) in \\(2^6\\) comes from the \\(2\\) options from our indicator. Each side has two options, and there are \\(6\\) sides. Thus, \\(2^6\\) possible events.\n\n\n2. What is an event??\nI think this will become clearer when we start thinking about events in the context of probability. When we think of events outside of probability, we may think of something we actually do or something that happens, like going to a concert or coming to class or missing the streetcar. In this case, we think of the event as the single thing (out of all the options) that actually occured. For example, if I’m taking the streetcar to class, I can think of two definitive options of what might occur: I miss the streetcar or I get on the streetcar. Only one of these things can occur, which I may call an event colloquially.\nIt is important to make the distinction with events defined within probability. Events are not necessarily a single thing that occurred. Instead it can be a collection of things that may occur. In the example of the streetcar, I can define my event to include both options. Thus, my event is that I make the streetcar or I miss it. Both of these things cannot happen simultaneously, but if I want to calculate the probability that I miss or make the streetcar, then it is helpful to have the event defined."

What value do you expect to get on a roll? :::\nSolution:\nRemark: Expected vs. actual outcomes\n\n\nDefinition 3 (Expected value). The expected value of a discrete r.v. \\(X\\) that takes on values \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n\\) is \\[\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\sum_{i=1}^n x_ip_X(x_i).\\]\n\nRemarks:\n\nThe definition holds if the r.v. \\(X\\) takes on countably infinitely many values \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots\\), as well: \\[\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} x_ip_X(x_i).\\]\nAnother way to define the expected value of a discrete r.v. is to do so at the \\(\\omega\\) level, where the \\(\\omega\\)’s are outcomes in the sample space:\n\nSuppose \\(\\omega_1, \\omega_2, \\ldots, \\omega_n\\) are the possible outcomes of a random phenomenon. If outcome \\(\\omega_i\\) causes the r.v. X to take on value \\(x_i\\) (meaning \\(X(\\omega_i)=x_i\\)), then \\[\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} x_i\\mathbb{P}(\\{\\omega_i\\}).\\]\n\n\n\nExample 4. Suppose \\[X = \\left\\{\n        \\begin{array}{ll}\n            1 & \\quad \\mathrm{with\\ probability}\\ p \\quad\\mathrm{(success)}\\\\\n            0 & \\quad \\mathrm{with\\ probability}\\ 1-p \\quad\\mathrm{(failure)}\n        \\end{array}\n    \\right.\\] Find the expected value of \\(X\\).\n\nSolution:\n\n\nExample 5. Suppose \\[X = \\left\\{\n        \\begin{array}{ll}\n            1 & \\quad \\mathrm{with\\ probability}\\ p \\\\\n            -1 & \\quad \\mathrm{with\\ probability}\\ 1-p\n        \\end{array}\n    \\right.\\] Find the expected value of \\(X\\).\n\nSolution:\n\nExample 6. Suppose I throw darts at a dartboard until I hit the bullseye, and that my probability of hitting the bullseye is \\(p\\). Suppose further that all of my throws are independent, and that the probability of a bullseye never changes, no matter how many times I throw a dart. How many times should I expect to have to throw the dart until I hit the bullseye?\n\nSolution:\n\nExample 7. A ghost is trick-or-treating. It comes to a house where it is known that there are 30 candies in the bag and only one is a watermelon Jolly Rancher, which is the ghost’s favorite. The ghost takes pieces of candy without replacement until it gets the watermelon Jolly Rancher. How many pieces of candy do we expect the ghost to take?\n\nSolution:\nRemark: Both examples are repeated random processes. They are fundamentally different though:\n\nThe bullseye example (6) is \"with replacement\" since the probability of success remains constant.\nThe ghost trick-or-treating example (7) is without replacement, and thus the probability of success changes with each trial."

    "text": "Online Resources\n\nSlack\nWe will use Slack as our main form of communication for the class. If you are unsure how to do a homework problem or have other questions, please ask myself or the TAs either by email or posting your question(s) on Slack. Please know that Slack is not guarded by the OSHU firewall, so if you have a question about accommodations or any sensitive topics, you may wish to message me via email. You can still message me regarding sensitive information on Slack, but I will not initiate those conversations on Slack.\n**Please use this invitation link for our Slack workspace!**\n\nTips on asking questions\n\nIf you are unsure how to do a homework problem or have other questions, please ask myself or the TA’s either by email or posting your question(s) on Slack. \nWhen reaching out for help for a homework problem, please include some context on what you have already tried.\n\nFor example, including a photo of your work thus far with an explanation of where you think you might be wrong is a quick way for me to look it over your work and help you troubleshoot. This helps me see what parts you already understand and which you need help with.\nIf you are unsure how to start a problem, look through your notes and the book for examples that you think might be similar. When reaching out, mention these examples and why you think they might be helpful, but also why you are still unsure on how to proceed.\nIf you only write something similar to “I don’t know how to do problem xxx,” then my response will be to ask you what you tried so far. Thus, it will be quicker for you to let me know this information right away.\n\nIf asking for help about a specific example that you don’t understand, please also provide some detail beyond “I don’t understand example xxx.”\n\nWhich steps of the problem do you not understand? You can refer to a line number, for example.\nIf you don’t understand the first step, do you understand the ones following it?\n\nIn general, when asking a question, please provide the homework number it is from along with the chapter and problem number. If it’s an example from the notes or book, an example number or slide number will help finding it.\nWant more tips on asking questions? This list below is a good start. It’s from https://www.weareteachers.com/8-ways-to-pose-better-questions-in-math-class/.\nFinally, if I don’t respond within a day and you need a response soon, please remind me by emailing or messaging me again.\n\n\n\n\nSakai\nWhile most course materials will be delivered online through this website, assignments will be turned in through Sakai, OHSU’s course management system. I will include a link on this website to the Sakai assignment page. \n\n\nExplain Everything\nI plan to use Explain Everything on my iPad to deliver lectures. This application allows me to take real-time notes, access Poll Everywhere, and record the lecture. I hope to use these features to allow you to follow me during lecture and have access to a recording for asynchronous viewing. While I will try to always make a recorded lecture available to you after class, I want you to try to attend class in person. I understand that life events get in the way of in-person attendance, but your attendance in-person brings me joy while I teach, and then further motivates me to be a great teacher. \nNote: I am new to this application so I ask you for some grace as I learn to navigate it. \n\n\nWebex\nWebex software will be used for virtual office hours. To give everyone the best possible experience with Webex, we recommend the following best practices:\n\nPlease stay muted until you want to participate\nDuring office hours, please send a message in chat with your question or with a statement like “I have a question.” This makes sure I or the TA can address everyone’s questions in order. \nI encourage you to attend office hours with your video on. This helps me recognize you, and keep mental notes on what techniques/concepts I emphasize to facilitate your specific understanding. \n\n\n\nPoll Everywhere\nWe will use the Poll Everywhere tool as an interactive feature of the course. Poll Everywhere is a web-based application that allows students to participate by responding via text messages or by visiting a web page on an internet-enabled device (smartphone, tablet, laptop). Instructions will be displayed on-screen. The poll that is embedded within the presentation will update in real time. While there is no cost to use this software, standard text messaging rates will apply if you use your phone. Please make sure that you have a Poll Everywhere account before our first class. You are not required to use your OHSU/PSU email to make an account. \nDuring lectures I will pose questions to the class. These questions are designed to provide real-time feedback to both students and the instructor on how well students are grasping the material. This is meant to be an interactive, learning activity with NO contribution to your grade. Your identity will never be connected to your answers, so I encourage you to answer honestly.\n\n\nPennState STAT 414 Website\nPennState has a class offered to advanced undergraduates that has some overlap with our class. They have all their course notes posted on thispage. This is a great source if you would like to see class notes with different phrasing.\nNot all of our topics are covered in their notes, but the most important ones are. If you are having trouble finding our course’s concepts on their page, please make ask me at Office Hours, after class, or in a private meeting. I do not explicitly state corresponding sections under our schedule because I believe it is important for you to develop skills involving resources and learning key words that can help you find answers. \n\n\nR: Statistical Computing Software\nStudents will use statistical software to complete homework assignments. Students are required to use R/RStudio for this course. R can be freely downloaded. Helpful documentation on installing R is available. I encourage you to install R prior to attending our first lecture. Please email me if you need help installing R or RStudio.\nYou will need to download the following three things:\n\nR https://www.r-project.org/\nRstudio https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\nQuarto https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/\n\n\nAdditional R Resources\nYour learning and practicing of R will hopefully not be limited to this course. One of the best aspects of programming in R is that many resources are freely available online. Here are just a few additional resources you may explore beyond this class to continue your training in R.\n\n\nUseful online R resources\n\nR for the rest of us\nStatistical tools for high-throughput data analysis. ggplot2 essentials\nR-bloggers\nStack Overflow for troubleshooting\nR Graphical Manual\nQuick-R. Accessing the power of R\nR for SAS, STATA, and SPSS Users\nggplot2\nLearn R 4 free\nJoin a local R user groups\nLearning Machines\n\n\n\nOnline R courses to complement or refresh material from class\n\nR for the rest of us\nCoursera: R programming\nedX: R basics\nData Carpentry: For Biologists\nData Carpentry: For Ecologists\nPsychiatric R\nR coder"

This class may not be a priority to you, you may be taking several other courses, or you may need to dedicate time to other activities. Homeworks are formative assessments, meaning its purpose is to help you learn and practice. To reduce the pressure on you to have perfect or complete homework, I have a very simple grading policy: Your homework will be given a check mark if you turn something in (whether it is incomplete, complete, correct, or wrong). I highly encourage you to stay up-to-date with the homeworks and put in as much effort as you can. This will be the most helpful work in this class!\nAfter the due date, either the TA or myself will give you feedback (on one or more complete problems) and post the solutions.\n\n\nViewing Grades in Sakai\nPoints you receive for graded activities will be posted to the Sakai Gradebook. Click on the Gradebook link on the left navigation to view your points.\n\n\nLate Work Policy\nI encourage you to make your best effort to submit all assignments on time, but I understand circumstances arise that are beyond our control. Please see this Swansea University’s page on extenuating circumstances for some examples. Not all circumstances are covered here, so please reach out if you have questions. \n\nThe class will end on December 8, 2023. All coursework is expected to be completed by then. If you have extenuating circumstances, and need additional time to complete class assignments, please contact me. Together, we will come up with a plan for completion and to sort out registrar logistics.\nIf you have extenuating circumstances that may jeopardize your ability to do work for several weeks, please contact me. We will come up with a plan to keep you on track in the course and prevent any delay in your education.\nFor homework, there is a due date posted, but you may turn in the assignment any time before the class ends. I will give you the check regardless of when you submit the assignment. However, if you would like feedback on the homework, you must turn it in on time OR email me asking for feedback for your late homework.\nFor non-homework assignments, I ask you to email me directly. You can explain your circumstances and may ask me for an extension, but I won’t necessarily grant one.\nIf you have a emergency involving your self, family, pet, friend, classmate, or anything/one deemed important to you, please do not worry about immediately contacting me. We can work something out after your emergency. If I contact you during an emergency, it is only because I am worried, and you do NOT need to respond until you are able. \n\n\n\nRegrade Policy\nIf you think a question was incorrectly graded, first compare your answer to the answer key. If you believe a re-grade would be appropriate, write an email to me containing the question and a short explanation as to why the question(s) was/were incorrectly graded. Deadline: One week after assignments were returned to class (late requests will not be considered).\n\n\nAttendance Policy\nYou are expected to attend class and participate in-class polls and the exit ticket. For students who miss class or need a review, I will make video and audio recordings of lectures available. There are no guarantees against technical or other challenges for the recording availability or quality. For students who are unable to attend the class in-person and synchronously, viewing the recording within 7 days is acceptable. This is meant to keep you on track within the course and prevent a pile up of material. Make sure to complete the exit ticket to demonstrate attendance."

Your responses will be anonymous unless you elect to leave your email address. If I have done anything to make you feel uncomfortable, please give me feedback so I can change my behavior. Ultimately, this class is for you, and my individual social identity/behavior should not inhibit your learning. Thank you for your help making BSTA 513/613 a more successful class! Examples of ongoing feedback are:\n\nNicky talks a little fast during lecture time. May you speak slower?\nDuring Office Hours, Dr. Wakim made a face when I asked a question. This face made me feel self-conscious about my question.\nDr. W asked me a question about my experience that made me feel like a monolith for my race. Please do not assume I can speak on behalf of my social identity groups.\nThe in-class examples do not make me more interested in the material."

Please talk to me before or after class or stop by my office if there is anything you want to discuss or about which you are unclear. I want to be supportive of your learning and growth.\nInclusive & supportive learning community\nI believe that learning happens best when we all learn together, as a community. This means creating a space characterized by generous listening, civility, humility, patience, and hospitality. I will attempt to promote a safe climate where we examine content from multiple cultural perspectives, and I will strive to create and maintain a classroom atmosphere in which you feel free to both listen to others and express your views and ask questions to increase your learning.\nOpenness to feedback\nI appreciate straightforward feedback from you regarding how well the class is meeting your needs. Let me know if material is not clear or when its relevance to the student learning outcomes for the course is not apparent. In particular, let me know if you identify bias or stereotyping in my teaching materials as I will seek to continuously improve. Please also let me know if there’s an aspect of the class you find particularly interesting, helpful, or enjoyable!\nResponsiveness\nI will monitor email as well as the discussion board daily and try respond to all messages within 24 hours Monday-Friday.\nClear guidelines and prompt feedback on assignments\nI will provide clear instructions for all assignments, and a grading rubric when applicable.

I will expect all students, and all instructors, to be respectful of each other’s contributions, whether I agree with them or not. Professional interactions are expected.\nBuild rapport\nIf you find that you have any trouble keeping up with assignments or other aspects of the course, make sure you let me know as early as possible. As you will find, building rapport and effective relationships are key to becoming an effective professional. Make sure that you are proactive in informing me when difficulties arise during the semester so that I can help you find a solution.\nComplete assignments\nAll assignments for this course will be submitted electronically through Sakai unless otherwise instructed.  I encourage you to make your best effort to submit all assignments on time, but I understand that sometimes circumstances arise that are beyond our control. If you need an extension, please contact me in congruence with the Late Policy.\nSeek help if you need it\nI believe it is important to support the physical and emotional well‐being of my students. If you are experiencing physical or mental health issues, I encourage you to use the resources on campus such as those listed below. If you have a health issue that is affecting your performance or participation in the course, and/or if you need help connecting with these resources, please contact the instructor or any of the TAs.\n\nStudent Health and Wellness Center (SHW), Website, 503-494-8665 (OHSU Students only)\nStudent Health and Counseling (SHAC), Website, 503-725-2800\n\nInform your instructor of any accommodations needed\nYou should speak with or email me before or during the first week of classes regarding any special needs. Students seeking academic accommodations should register with the appropriate service under the School policies below.\nSome religious holidays may occur on regularly scheduled class days. Because available class hours are so limited in number, we will have to hold class on all such days. Class video recordings will be available and you are encouraged to engage with the material outside of the regular class time. You are also encouraged to come to office hours with questions from the session.\nCommit to integrity\nAs a student in this course (and at PSU or OHSU) you are expected to maintain high degrees of professionalism, commitment to active learning and participation in this class and also integrity in your behavior in and out of the classroom.\nCheating and other forms of academic misconduct will not be tolerated in this course and will be dealt with firmly. Student academic misconduct refers to behavior that includes plagiarism, cheating on assignments, fabrication of data, falsification of records or official documents, intentional misuse of equipment or materials (including library materials), or aiding and abetting the perpetration of such acts. Preparation of papers or homework, assigned on an individual basis, must represent each student’s own individual effort. When used, resource materials should be cited in conventional reference format."

Please know that Slack is not guarded by the OSHU firewall, so if you have a question about accommodations or any sensitive topics, you may wish to message me via email. You can still message me regarding sensitive information on Slack, but I will not initiate those conversations on Slack.\n**Please use this invitation link for our Slack workspace!**\n\nTips on asking questions\n\nIf you are unsure how to do a homework problem or have other questions, please ask myself or the TA’s either by email or posting your question(s) on Slack. \nWhen reaching out for help for a homework problem, please include some context on what you have already tried.\n\nFor example, including a photo of your work thus far with an explanation of where you think you might be wrong is a quick way for me to look it over your work and help you troubleshoot. This helps me see what parts you already understand and which you need help with.\nIf you are unsure how to start a problem, look through your notes and the book for examples that you think might be similar. When reaching out, mention these examples and why you think they might be helpful, but also why you are still unsure on how to proceed.\nIf you only write something similar to “I don’t know how to do problem xxx,” then my response will be to ask you what you tried so far. Thus, it will be quicker for you to let me know this information right away.\n\nIf asking for help about a specific example that you don’t understand, please also provide some detail beyond “I don’t understand example xxx.”\n\nWhich steps of the problem do you not understand? You can refer to a line number, for example.\nIf you don’t understand the first step, do you understand the ones following it?\n\nIn general, when asking a question, please provide the homework number it is from along with the chapter and problem number. If it’s an example from the notes or book, an example number or slide number will help finding it.\nWant more tips on asking questions? This list below is a good start. It’s from https://www.weareteachers.com/8-ways-to-pose-better-questions-in-math-class/.\nFinally, if I don’t respond within a day and you need a response soon, please remind me by emailing or messaging me again.\n\n\n\n\nSakai\nWhile most course materials will be delivered online through this website, assignments will be turned in through Sakai, OHSU’s course management system. I will include a link on this website to the Sakai assignment page. \n\n\nExplain Everything\nI plan to use Explain Everything on my iPad to deliver lectures. This application allows me to take real-time notes, access Poll Everywhere, and record the lecture. I hope to use these features to allow you to follow me during lecture and have access to a recording for asynchronous viewing. While I will try to always make a recorded lecture available to you after class, I want you to try to attend class in person. I understand that life events get in the way of in-person attendance, but your attendance in-person brings me joy while I teach, and then further motivates me to be a great teacher. \nNote: I am new to this application so I ask you for some grace as I learn to navigate it. \n\n\nWebex\nWebex software will be used for virtual office hours. To give everyone the best possible experience with Webex, we recommend the following best practices:\n\nPlease stay muted until you want to participate\nDuring office hours, please send a message in chat with your question or with a statement like “I have a question.” This makes sure I or the TA can address everyone’s questions in order. \nI encourage you to attend office hours with your video on. This helps me recognize you, and keep mental notes on what techniques/concepts I emphasize to facilitate your specific understanding. \n\n\n\nPoll Everywhere\nWe will use the Poll Everywhere tool as an interactive feature of the course. Poll Everywhere is a web-based application that allows students to participate by responding via text messages or by visiting a web page on an internet-enabled device (smartphone, tablet, laptop). Instructions will be displayed on-screen. The poll that is embedded within the presentation will update in real time. While there is no cost to use this software, standard text messaging rates will apply if you use your phone. Please make sure that you have a Poll Everywhere account before our first class. You are not required to use your OHSU/PSU email to make an account. \nDuring lectures I will pose questions to the class. These questions are designed to provide real-time feedback to both students and the instructor on how well students are grasping the material. This is meant to be an interactive, learning activity with NO contribution to your grade. Your identity will never be connected to your answers, so I encourage you to answer honestly.\n\n\nPennState STAT 414 Website\nPennState has a class offered to advanced undergraduates that has some overlap with our class. They have all their course notes posted on thispage. This is a great source if you would like to see class notes with different phrasing.\nNot all of our topics are covered in their notes, but the most important ones are. If you are having trouble finding our course’s concepts on their page, please make ask me at Office Hours, after class, or in a private meeting. I do not explicitly state corresponding sections under our schedule because I believe it is important for you to develop skills involving resources and learning key words that can help you find answers. \n\n\nR: Statistical Computing Software\nStudents will use statistical software to complete homework assignments. Students are required to use R/RStudio for this course. R can be freely downloaded. Helpful documentation on installing R is available. I encourage you to install R prior to attending our first lecture. Please email me if you need help installing R or RStudio.\nYou will need to download the following three things:\n\nR https://www.r-project.org/\nRstudio https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\nQuarto https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/\n\n\nAdditional R Resources\nYour learning and practicing of R will hopefully not be limited to this course. One of the best aspects of programming in R is that many resources are freely available online. Here are just a few additional resources you may explore beyond this class to continue your training in R.\n\n\nUseful online R resources\n\nR for the rest of us\nStatistical tools for high-throughput data analysis. ggplot2 essentials\nR-bloggers\nStack Overflow for troubleshooting\nR Graphical Manual\nQuick-R.

    "section": "Assessment",
    "text": "Assessment\nThe course is structured around the following four components:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nModality\nFrequency\nDescription\n\n\nLecture\nIn person\nTwice, Weekly\nCourse content is provided through in-person lectures. Lectures will consist of didactic lessons, interactive examples, and PollEverywhere questions. Sessions will be recorded through Explain Everything and posted to Sakai. Attending or viewing the lecture within 7 days of the original lecture date is mandatory. Class attendance will be taken through an Exit Ticket. If viewing the lecture asynchronously, you must take the Exit Ticket to verify your attendance.\n\n\nHomework\nOnline\nWeekly\nThe course includes 6 homework assignments. They are an opportunity for you to engage with important concepts, practice coding, and apply calculating skills. Homework assignments should be submitted online, and will be graded by TAs. Students are encouraged to work in groups for homework assignments, but each person should do their own summary and hand in their work. Homework assignments will be due on Thursday at 11 PM.\n\n\nMidterm Exam\nIn person\nOnce\nThe purpose of the midterm is to assess how well you have achieved the learning objectives through questions covering important concepts, conducting statistical processes, and interpreting output. We will have our midterm in-class, and it will be open book. Students must work on the exam independently.\n\n\nFinal Exam\nIn person\nOnce\nThe purpose of the final is to assess how well you have achieved the learning objectives through questions covering important concepts, conducting statistical processes, and interpreting output. We will have our final in-class, and it will be open book. Students must work on the exam independently. While the final exam is not explicitly cumulative, certain topics learned before the midterm will carry over to material in the later part of the course.\n\n\n\n\nTypes of assessments\nThis class will use a combination of formative and summative assessments to build and test our knowledge. Below I define each of these types of assessments:\n\nFormative assessment: Activity or work meant to help students learn and practice. Feedback on these assessments are meant to help the instructor and student identify gaps in knowledge and highlight accomplishments.\nSummative assessment: Work meant to test how well students have achieved learning objectives. Grading of these assessments are meant to gauge how well a student grasps the learning objectives and will be able to use their knowledge outside of the classroom.\n\n\n\nBreakdown\n\nGrading & Requirements\nLetter grades will be assigned roughly according to the following scheme: A (&gt;=93%), A- (90-92%), B+ (88-89%), B(83-87%), B- (82-80%), C+(78-79%), C(73-77%), C- (70-72%), D (60 – 69%), F(&lt;60%).\nGrades will be based on homework assignments, midterm exam, class “attendance”, and final exam, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse activity\nType of Assessment\nDue Date\nPercentage of final grade\n\n\nHomework\nFormative\nApprox. weekly\n55%\n\n\nPost-class survey\nN/A\nTwice Weekly\n5%\n\n\nMidterm Exam\nSummative\n\n20%\n\n\nFinal Exam\nSummative\n\n20%\n\n\n\n\n\nCriteria\n\nHomework grading\nNo student has the same amount of time available to dedicate to homework. This class may not be a priority to you, you may be taking several other courses, or you may need to dedicate time to other activities. Homeworks are formative assessments, meaning its purpose is to help you learn and practice. To reduce the pressure on you to have perfect or complete homework, I have a very simple grading policy: Your homework will be given a check mark if you turn something in (whether it is incomplete, complete, correct, or wrong). I highly encourage you to stay up-to-date with the homeworks and put in as much effort as you can. This will be the most helpful work in this class!\nAfter the due date, either the TA or myself will give you feedback (on one or more complete problems) and post the solutions.\n\n\n\nViewing Grades in Sakai\nPoints you receive for graded activities will be posted to the Sakai Gradebook. Click on the Gradebook link on the left navigation to view your points."

This form will be available on Sakai. Students can submit feedback at any time and this form will be reviewed regularly by me. Your responses will be anonymous unless you elect to leave your email address. If I have done anything to make you feel uncomfortable, please give me feedback so I can change my behavior. Ultimately, this class is for you, and my individual social identity/behavior should not inhibit your learning. Thank you for your help making BSTA 513/613 a more successful class! Examples of ongoing feedback are:\n\nNicky talks a little fast during lecture time. May you speak slower?\nDuring Office Hours, Dr. Wakim made a face when I asked a question. This face made me feel self-conscious about my question.\nDr. W asked me a question about my experience that made me feel like a monolith for my race. Please do not assume I can speak on behalf of my social identity groups.\nThe in-class examples do not make me more interested in the material.\n\n\n\nMidterm Feedback\nDuring the middle of the quarter, I will ask you to submit guided, anonymous feedback. Completion of feedback will be count towards your midterm exam grade. To insure anonymity, I will ask you to sign a separate, written statement that you completed the feedback.\n\n\nFinal Course Feedback\nAt the conclusion of the course, you will be asked to complete a formal online review of the course and the instructor. Your feedback on this University evaluation is critical to improving future student learning in this course as well as providing metrics relevant to the instructor’s career advancement."

    "text": "How to succeed in this course\nEvery professor has different expectations when assigning certain work or providing certain resources. I want to walk through each class resource and assignment so that you know what you can do to succeed in this class. For resources, I want you to optimize the opportunities to learn. For assignments, I want you to know the strategies that students can use to learn the most and prepare for future exams.\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResource\nWhat is it?\nHow do I use it?\n\n\nOffice Hours\nBlocks of time where a professor or TA dedicates for questions. The teaching staff will be located in a specific room. Several students may enter the space at a time and will ask specific or broad questions. If many students attend office hours, a queue will be created so that students can be served equally.\nThe main use of office hours is to ask questions about an assignment or lecture notes. You are welcome to sit and do homework in office hours. OH are also an informal way of meeting fellow students to collaborate with.\n\n\nLectures and lecture recordings\nTime shared between the professor and students where the professor conveys important class material. Material discussed in lectures include concepts, calculations, code, and examples. Lectures are a mix of presentation of information, working through examples together, interactive activities, and in-class polls.\nStudents should attend lectures in person if possible. You should attempt to understand new material presented by following the presentation slides, taking notes on additional details that may conveyed verbally, and working through examples with the professor. Students are encouraged to ask questions when you don’t understand the material at any point in the lecture.\n\n\nTextbooks\nWritten and published material that explains concepts, steps through calculations, provides examples, and provides practice problems. The listed textbooks is the basis for this course. While I am to cover all topics in class, the textbook provides alternative explanations and additional examples.\nWhile coming to class having read the accompanying textbook chapters helps understanding during class, I do not expect students to have read it. I see the textbook as a good resource if you are struggling with a specific topic after class, in need of an example while working on homework, or want additional practice when studying for the exam.\n\n\nWebsite\nThe course website is designed by me so that you have access to all the course materials in a more organized and flexible way. All resources delivered from me to you will be available on the website. Any assignments turned in will be through Sakai.\nYou can navigate through different course resources and information using the left-side tabs or top navigation bar. Course materials, like lecture notes, homework, data examples, and recordings, can be found under each week’s page under the schedule tab. You can also find the individual resources under the “Course Materials” tab on the left. Links to turn in assignments through Sakai will be given on the website. Please explore the tabs and get a sense of the organization.\n\n\nSakai\nSakai is a learning management system for higher ed. This is the university sanctioned LMS where we will submit assignments.\nYou will turn in assignments through Sakai under the “Submissions” tab. Generally, there will be a link to each assignment on the course website. You can also view your grades under “Gradebook” and links to Webex under “Webex.”\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment\nType of assessment\nBefore you submit/take it\nAfter it is graded\n\n\nHomework\nFormative\n\nWork out each problem on your own as much as you can\nTalk through problems with a peer\nGo to Office Hours for help\nWrite down work that shows your thought process\nSearch your issue on Stack Exchange/Stack Overflow\n\n\nReview the solutions\nReview your mistakes\nFor solutions that involve writing sentences, check with me or a TA if your answer fits the solution\nGo to Office Hours to ask about your solutions\n\n\n\nMidterm / Final Exam\nSummative\n\nIdentify and achieve learning objectives in each lecture\nUnderstand why certain statistics tools are used for certain cases\nPractice problems that you struggled with\nCome to Office Hours for help with specific problems or concepts\n\n\nReview the solutions\nReview your mistakes\nFor solutions that involve writing sentences, check with me or a TA if your answer fits the solution\nGo to Office Hours to ask about your solutions\nDo not ask for a regrade unless you have viewed the solutions\n\n\n\nClass Surveys\nN/A\n\nBring appropriate electronic device to participate in polls\nComplete the survey during the last 5 minutes of class or after class within 7 days\n\n\nReview muddiest and clearest points from the week\n\n\n\n\nIf you would like any other course resources explained in this format, please request it through the Ongoing Course Feedback."

Please see this Swansea University’s page on extenuating circumstances for some examples. Not all circumstances are covered here, so please reach out if you have questions. \n\nThe class will end on December 8, 2023. All coursework is expected to be completed by then. If you have extenuating circumstances, and need additional time to complete class assignments, please contact me. Together, we will come up with a plan for completion and to sort out registrar logistics.\nIf you have extenuating circumstances that may jeopardize your ability to do work for several weeks, please contact me. We will come up with a plan to keep you on track in the course and prevent any delay in your education.\nFor homework, there is a due date posted, but you may turn in the assignment any time before the class ends. I will give you the check regardless of when you submit the assignment. However, if you would like feedback on the homework, you must turn it in on time OR email me asking for feedback for your late homework.\nFor non-homework assignments, I ask you to email me directly. You can explain your circumstances and may ask me for an extension, but I won’t necessarily grant one.\nIf you have a emergency involving your self, family, pet, friend, classmate, or anything/one deemed important to you, please do not worry about immediately contacting me. We can work something out after your emergency. If I contact you during an emergency, it is only because I am worried, and you do NOT need to respond until you are able. \n\n\n\nRegrade Policy\nIf you think a question was incorrectly graded, first compare your answer to the answer key. If you believe a re-grade would be appropriate, write an email to me containing the question and a short explanation as to why the question(s) was/were incorrectly graded. Deadline: One week after assignments were returned to class (late requests will not be considered).\n\n\nAttendance Policy\nYou are expected to attend class and participate in-class polls and the exit ticket. For students who miss class or need a review, I will make video and audio recordings of lectures available. There are no guarantees against technical or other challenges for the recording availability or quality. For students who are unable to attend the class in-person and synchronously, viewing the recording within 7 days is acceptable. This is meant to keep you on track within the course and prevent a pile up of material. Make sure to complete the exit ticket to demonstrate attendance.\n\n\nInstructor Expectations\nCommitment to your learning and your success\nI believe that everyone has the ability to be successful in this course and I have put a lot of effort into designing the course in a way that maximizes your learning to ensure your success. Please talk to me before or after class or stop by my office if there is anything you want to discuss or about which you are unclear. I want to be supportive of your learning and growth.\nInclusive & supportive learning community\nI believe that learning happens best when we all learn together, as a community. This means creating a space characterized by generous listening, civility, humility, patience, and hospitality. I will attempt to promote a safe climate where we examine content from multiple cultural perspectives, and I will strive to create and maintain a classroom atmosphere in which you feel free to both listen to others and express your views and ask questions to increase your learning.\nOpenness to feedback\nI appreciate straightforward feedback from you regarding how well the class is meeting your needs. Let me know if material is not clear or when its relevance to the student learning outcomes for the course is not apparent. In particular, let me know if you identify bias or stereotyping in my teaching materials as I will seek to continuously improve. Please also let me know if there’s an aspect of the class you find particularly interesting, helpful, or enjoyable!\nResponsiveness\nI will monitor email as well as the discussion board daily and try respond to all messages within 24 hours Monday-Friday.\nClear guidelines and prompt feedback on assignments\nI will provide clear instructions for all assignments, and a grading rubric when applicable. I will provide detailed feedback on your submissions and will update grades promptly in Sakai.\n\n\nStudent Expectations and Resources\nAttend class\nYou are expected to attend all scheduled class meetings synchronously or watch the recording within 7 days. Attendance is taken through exit tickets. If you have issues accessing the poll on a specific day, please let me know. \nParticipate\nI encourage you to participate actively in class and online discussions. I will expect all students, and all instructors, to be respectful of each other’s contributions, whether I agree with them or not. Professional interactions are expected.\nBuild rapport\nIf you find that you have any trouble keeping up with assignments or other aspects of the course, make sure you let me know as early as possible. As you will find, building rapport and effective relationships are key to becoming an effective professional. Make sure that you are proactive in informing me when difficulties arise during the semester so that I can help you find a solution.\nComplete assignments\nAll assignments for this course will be submitted electronically through Sakai unless otherwise instructed.  I encourage you to make your best effort to submit all assignments on time, but I understand that sometimes circumstances arise that are beyond our control. If you need an extension, please contact me in congruence with the Late Policy.\nSeek help if you need it\nI believe it is important to support the physical and emotional well‐being of my students. If you are experiencing physical or mental health issues, I encourage you to use the resources on campus such as those listed below. If you have a health issue that is affecting your performance or participation in the course, and/or if you need help connecting with these resources, please contact the instructor or any of the TAs.\n\nStudent Health and Wellness Center (SHW), Website, 503-494-8665 (OHSU Students only)\nStudent Health and Counseling (SHAC), Website, 503-725-2800\n\nInform your instructor of any accommodations needed\nYou should speak with or email me before or during the first week of classes regarding any special needs. Students seeking academic accommodations should register with the appropriate service under the School policies below.\nSome religious holidays may occur on regularly scheduled class days. Because available class hours are so limited in number, we will have to hold class on all such days. Class video recordings will be available and you are encouraged to engage with the material outside of the regular class time. You are also encouraged to come to office hours with questions from the session.\nCommit to integrity\nAs a student in this course (and at PSU or OHSU) you are expected to maintain high degrees of professionalism, commitment to active learning and participation in this class and also integrity in your behavior in and out of the classroom.\nCheating and other forms of academic misconduct will not be tolerated in this course and will be dealt with firmly. Student academic misconduct refers to behavior that includes plagiarism, cheating on assignments, fabrication of data, falsification of records or official documents, intentional misuse of equipment or materials (including library materials), or aiding and abetting the perpetration of such acts. Preparation of papers or homework, assigned on an individual basis, must represent each student’s own individual effort. When used, resource materials should be cited in conventional reference format."

    "text": "Chapter 9: Independence and Conditioning - or, Joint Distributions\n\nDefinition 1. The joint pmf of a pair of discrete r.v.’s \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is \\[p_{X,Y}(x,y) = \\mathbb{P}(X=x\\ and\\ Y=y) = \\mathbb{P}(X=x, Y=y)\\]\n\n\nExample 2. Let \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) be two random draws from a box containing balls labelled 1, 2, and 3 without replacement.\n\nFind \\(p_{X,Y}(x,y)\\).\nFind \\(\\mathbb{P}(X+Y=3).\\)\nFind \\(\\mathbb{P}(Y = 1).\\)\nFind \\(\\mathbb{P}(Y \\leq 2).\\)\n\n\nSolution:\nRemarks: Some properties of joint pmf’s:\n\nA joint pmf \\(p_{X,Y}(x,y)\\) must satisfy the following properties:\n\n\\(p_{X,Y}(x,y)\\geq 0\\) for all \\(x, y\\).\n\\(\\sum \\limits_{\\{all\\ x\\}} \\sum \\limits_{\\{all\\ y\\}} p_{X,Y}(x,y)=1\\).\n\nMarginal pmf’s:\n\n\\(p_X(x) = \\sum \\limits_{\\{all\\ y\\}} p_{X,Y}(x,y)\\)\n\\(p_Y(y) = \\sum \\limits_{\\{all\\ x\\}} p_{X,Y}(x,y)\\)\n\n\n\nDefinition 3. The joint cdf of a pair of discrete r.v.’s \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is \\[F_{X,Y}(x,y) = \\mathbb{P}(X \\leq x\\ and\\ Y \\leq y) = \\mathbb{P}(X \\leq x, Y \\leq y)\\]\n\n\n\nExample 4. Find the joint cdf \\(F_{X,Y}(x,y)\\) for the joint pmf \\(p_{X,Y}(x,y)\\) in Example 2.\n\nSolution:\n\nExample 5. Find the marginal cdfs \\(F_{X}(x)\\) and \\(F_{Y}(y)\\) for Example 4.\n\nSolution:\n\nRemark: Some properties of joint cdf’s:\nIndependence and Conditioning\nRecall that for events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\),\n\n\\(\\mathbb{P}(A|B) = \\frac{\\mathbb{P}(A \\cap B)}{\\mathbb{P}(B)}\\)\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are independent if and only if\n\n\\(\\mathbb{P}(A|B) = \\mathbb{P}(A)\\)\n\\(\\mathbb{P}(A \\cap B) = \\mathbb{P}(A)\\cdot\\mathbb{P}(B)\\)\n\n\nIndependence and conditioning are defined similarly for r.v.’s, since \\[p_X(x) = \\mathbb{P}(X=x)\\ \\mathrm{and}\\ \\ p_{X,Y}(x,y) = \\mathbb{P}(X = x ,Y = y).\\]\n\nDefinition 6. The conditional pmf of a pair of discrete r.v.’s \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is defined as \\[p_{X|Y}(x|y) = \\mathbb{P}(X = x |Y = y) = \\frac{\\mathbb{P}(X = x\\ and\\ Y = y)}{\\mathbb{P}(Y = y)}\n=\\frac{p_{X,Y}(x,y) }{p_{Y}(y) }\\] if \\(p_{Y}(y) &gt; 0\\).\n\nRemark: The following properties follow from the conditional pmf definition:\n\nExample 7. Using \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) from Example 2:\n\nFind \\(p_{X|Y}(x|y)\\).\nAre \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) independent? Why or why not?\n\n\nSolution:\n\nRemark:\n\nTo show that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are not independent, we just need to find one counterexample.\nHowever, to show that they are independent, we need to verify this for all possible pairs of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\n\nExample 8. Hypothetical 4-sided die\n\nSuppose you have a 4-sided die, and you roll the 4-sided die until the first 4 appears.\nLet \\(X\\) be the number of rolls required until (and including) the first 4.\nAfter the first 4, you keep rolling it again until you roll a 3.\nLet \\(Y\\) be the number of rolls, after the first 4, required until (and including) the 3.\n\n\nFind \\(p_{X,Y}(x,y)\\).\nUsing \\(p_{X,Y}(x,y)\\), find \\(p_{Y}(y)\\).\nFind \\(p_{X}(x)\\).\nAre \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent? Why or why not?\nFind \\(F_{X,Y}(x,y)\\).\n\n\nSolution:\nExample 8 cont’d."

Dobrow, Wiley 2013 (eBook available from OHSU library)\nAn Introduction to R (free pdf available)\n\n\n\n\nOnline Resources\n\nSlack\nWe will use Slack as our main form of communication for the class. If you are unsure how to do a homework problem or have other questions, please ask me by posting your question(s) on Slack. Please know that Slack is not guarded by the OSHU firewall, so if you have a question about accommodations or any sensitive topics, you may wish to message me via email. You can still message me regarding sensitive information on Slack, but I will not initiate those conversations on Slack.\n**Please use this invitation link for our Slack workspace!**\nTips on asking questions:\n\nWhen reaching out for help for a homework problem, please include some context on what you have already tried.\n\nFor example, including a photo of your work thus far with an explanation of where you think you might be wrong is a quick way for me to look it over your work and help you troubleshoot. This helps me see what parts you already understand and which you need help with. If your question involves code, please include the copied code (not a screenshot) and an attachment to your full file. This way I can see the exact line you need help with and the full code in case the problem starts earlier.\nIf you are unsure how to start a problem, look through your notes and the book for examples that you think might be similar. When reaching out, mention these examples and why you think they might be helpful, but also why you are still unsure on how to proceed.\nIf you only write something similar to “I don’t know how to do problem xxx,” then my response will be to ask you what you tried so far. Thus, it will be quicker for you to let me know this information right away.\n\nIf asking for help about a specific example that you don’t understand, please also provide some detail beyond “I don’t understand example xxx.”\n\nWhich steps of the problem do you not understand? You can refer to a line number, for example.\nIf you don’t understand the first step, do you understand the ones following it?\n\nIn general, when asking a question, please provide the homework number it is from along with the chapter and problem number. If it’s an example from the notes or book, an example number or slide number will help finding it.\nWant more tips on asking questions? This list on this site will help!\nFinally, if I don’t respond within a day and you need a response soon, please remind me by emailing or messaging me again.\n\n\n\nSakai\nWhile most course materials will be delivered online through this website, assignments will be turned in through Sakai, OHSU’s course management system. I will include a link on this website to the Sakai assignment page. \n\n\nExplain Everything\nI plan to use Explain Everything on my iPad to deliver lectures. This application allows me to take real-time notes, access Poll Everywhere, and record the lecture. I hope to use these features to allow you to follow me during lecture and have access to a recording for asynchronous viewing. While I will try to always make a recorded lecture available to you after class, I want you to try to attend class in person. I understand that life events get in the way of in-person attendance, but your attendance in-person brings me joy while I teach, and then further motivates me to be a great teacher. \n\n\nWebex\nWebex software will be used for virtual office hours. To give everyone the best possible experience with Webex, I recommend the following best practices:\n\nPlease stay muted until you want to participate\nDuring office hours, please send a message in chat with your question or with a statement like “I have a question.” This makes sure I or the TA can address everyone’s questions in order. \nI encourage you to attend office hours with your video on. This helps me recognize you, and keep mental notes on what techniques/concepts I emphasize to facilitate your specific understanding. \n\n\n\nPoll Everywhere\nWe will use the Poll Everywhere tool as an interactive feature of the course. Poll Everywhere is a web-based application that allows students to participate by responding via text messages or by visiting a web page on an internet-enabled device (smartphone, tablet, laptop). Instructions will be displayed on-screen. The poll that is embedded within the presentation will update in real time. While there is no cost to use this software, standard text messaging rates will apply if you use your phone. Please make sure that you have a Poll Everywhere account before our first class. You are not required to use your OHSU/PSU email to make an account. \nDuring lectures I will pose questions to the class. These questions are designed to provide real-time feedback to both students and the instructor on how well students are grasping the material. This is meant to be an interactive, learning activity with NO contribution to your grade. Your identity will never be connected to your answers, so I encourage you to answer honestly.\n\n\nPennState STAT 414 Website\nPennState has a class offered to advanced undergraduates that has some overlap with our class. They have all their course notes posted on this page. This is a great source if you would like to see class notes with different phrasing.\nNot all of our topics are covered in their notes, but the most important ones are. If you are having trouble finding our course’s concepts on their page, please make ask me at Office Hours, after class, or in a private meeting. I do not explicitly state corresponding sections under our schedule because I believe it is important for you to develop skills involving resources and learning key words that can help you find answers. \n\n\nR: Statistical Computing Software\nStudents will use statistical software to complete homework assignments. Students are required to use R/RStudio for this course. R can be freely downloaded. Helpful documentation on installing R is available. I encourage you to install R prior to attending our first lecture. Please email me if you need help installing R or RStudio.\nYou will need to download the following three things:\n\nR https://www.r-project.org/\nRstudio https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\nQuarto https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/\n\n\nAdditional R Resources\nYour learning and practicing of R will hopefully not be limited to this course. One of the best aspects of programming in R is that many resources are freely available online. Here are just a few additional resources you may explore beyond this class to continue your training in R.\n\n\nUseful online R resources\n\nR for the rest of us\nStatistical tools for high-throughput data analysis. ggplot2 essentials\nR-bloggers\nStack Overflow for troubleshooting\nR Graphical Manual\nQuick-R.

    "text": "Assessment\nThe course is structured around the following four components:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nModality\nFrequency\nDescription\n\n\nLecture\nIn person\nTwice, Weekly\nCourse content is provided through in-person lectures. Lectures will consist of didactic lessons, interactive examples, and PollEverywhere questions. Sessions will be recorded through Explain Everything and posted to Sakai. Attending or viewing the lecture within 7 days of the original lecture date is mandatory. Class attendance will be taken through an Exit Ticket. If viewing the lecture asynchronously, you must take the Exit Ticket to verify your attendance.\n\n\nHomework\nOnline\nWeekly\nThe course includes 7 homework assignments. They are an opportunity for you to engage with important concepts, practice coding, and apply calculating skills. Homework assignments should be submitted online, and will be graded by me. Students are encouraged to work in groups for homework assignments, but each person should do their own summary and hand in their work. Homework assignments will be due on Thursday at 11 PM.\n\n\nMidterm Exam\nIn person\nOnce\nThe purpose of the midterm is to assess how well you have achieved the learning objectives through questions covering important concepts, conducting statistical processes, and interpreting output. We will have our midterm in-class, and it will be open book. Students must work on the exam independently.\n\n\nFinal Exam\nIn person\nOnce\nThe purpose of the final is to assess how well you have achieved the learning objectives through questions covering important concepts, conducting statistical processes, and interpreting output. We will have our final in-class, and it will be open book. Students must work on the exam independently. While the final exam is not explicitly cumulative, certain topics learned before the midterm will carry over to material in the later part of the course.\n\n\n\n\nTypes of assessments\nThis class will use a combination of formative and summative assessments to build and test our knowledge. Below I define each of these types of assessments:\n\nFormative assessment: Activity or work meant to help students learn and practice. Feedback on these assessments are meant to help the instructor and student identify gaps in knowledge and highlight accomplishments.\nSummative assessment: Work meant to test how well students have achieved learning objectives. Grading of these assessments are meant to gauge how well a student grasps the learning objectives and will be able to use their knowledge outside of the classroom.\n\n\n\nBreakdown\n\nGrading & Requirements\nLetter grades will be assigned roughly according to the following scheme: A (&gt;=93%), A- (90-92%), B+ (88-89%), B(83-87%), B- (82-80%), C+(78-79%), C(73-77%), C- (70-72%), D (60 – 69%), F(&lt;60%).\nGrades will be based on homework assignments, midterm exam, class “attendance”, and final exam, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse activity\nType of Assessment\nDue Date\nPercentage of final grade\n\n\nHomework\nFormative\nApprox. weekly\n53%\n\n\nPost-class survey\nN/A\nTwice Weekly\n5%\n\n\nMidterm Exam\nSummative\n11/1\n20%\n\n\nMidterm Feedback\nN/A\nTBD\n2%\n\n\nFinal Exam\nSummative\n12/4\n20%\n\n\n\n\n\nHomework grading\nNo student has the same amount of time available to dedicate to homework. This class may not be a priority to you, you may be taking several other courses, or you may need to dedicate time to other activities. Homeworks are formative assessments, meaning its purpose is to help you learn and practice. To reduce the pressure on you to have perfect or complete homework, I have a very simple grading policy: Your homework will be given a check mark if you turn something in (whether it is incomplete, complete, correct, or wrong). I highly encourage you to stay up-to-date with the homeworks and put in as much effort as you can. This will be the most helpful work in this class!\nAfter the due date, I will give you feedback (on one or more complete problems) and post the solutions.\n\n\nViewing Grades in Sakai\nPoints you receive for graded activities will be posted to the Sakai Gradebook. Click on the Gradebook link on the left navigation to view your points."

This form will be available on Sakai. Students can submit feedback at any time and this form will be reviewed regularly by me. Your responses will be anonymous unless you elect to leave your email address. If I have done anything to make you feel uncomfortable, please give me feedback so I can change my behavior. Ultimately, this class is for you, and my individual social identity/behavior should not inhibit your learning. Thank you for your help making BSTA 550 a more successful class! Examples of ongoing feedback are:\n\nNicky talks a little fast during lecture time. May you speak slower?\nDuring Office Hours, Dr. Wakim made a face when I asked a question. This face made me feel self-conscious about my question.\nDr. W asked me a question about my experience that made me feel like a monolith. Please do not assume I can speak on behalf of my social identity groups.\nThe in-class examples do not make me more interested in the material.\n\n\n\nMidterm Feedback\nDuring the middle of the quarter, I will ask you to submit guided, anonymous feedback. Completion of feedback will be count towards your grade. To insure anonymity, I will ask you to sign a separate, written statement that you completed the feedback.\n\n\nFinal Course Feedback\nAt the conclusion of the course, you will be asked to complete a formal online review of the course and the instructor. Your feedback on this University evaluation is critical to improving future student learning in this course as well as providing metrics relevant to the instructor’s career advancement (or lack of). Since our class is on the smaller side, everyone’s participation is needed for feedback to be released."

    "text": "How to succeed in this course\nEvery professor has different expectations when assigning certain work or providing certain resources. I want to walk through each class resource and assignment so that you know what you can do to succeed in this class. For resources, I want you to optimize the opportunities to learn. For assignments, I want you to know the strategies that students can use to learn the most and prepare for future exams.\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResource\nWhat is it?\nHow do I use it?\n\n\nOffice Hours\nBlocks of time a professor or TA dedicates for questions. The teaching staff will be located in a specific room. Several students may enter the space at a time and will ask specific or broad questions. If many students attend office hours, a queue will be created so that students can be served equally.\nThe main use of office hours is to ask questions about an assignment or lecture notes. You are welcome to sit and do homework in office hours. OH are also an informal way of meeting fellow students to collaborate with.\n\n\nLectures and lecture recordings\nTime shared between the professor and students where the professor conveys important class material. Material discussed in lectures include concepts, calculations, code, and examples. Lectures are a mix of presentation of information, working through examples together, interactive activities, and in-class polls.\nStudents should attend lectures in person if possible. You should attempt to understand new material presented by following the presentation slides, taking notes on additional details that may conveyed verbally, and working through examples with the professor. Students are encouraged to ask questions when you don’t understand the material at any point in the lecture.\n\n\nTextbooks\nWritten and published material that explains concepts, steps through calculations, provides examples, and provides practice problems. The listed textbooks is the basis for this course. While I am to cover all topics in class, the textbook provides alternative explanations and additional examples.\nWhile coming to class having read the accompanying textbook chapters helps understanding during class, I do not expect students to have read it. I see the textbook as a good resource if you are struggling with a specific topic after class, in need of an example while working on homework, or want additional practice when studying for the exam.\n\n\nWebsite\nThe course website is designed by me so that you have access to all the course materials in a more organized and flexible way. All resources delivered from me to you will be available on the website. Any assignments turned in will be through Sakai.\nYou can navigate through different course resources and information using the left-side tabs or top navigation bar. Course materials, like lecture notes, homework, data examples, and recordings, can be found under each week’s page under the schedule tab. You can also find the individual resources under the “Course Materials” tab on the left. Links to turn in assignments through Sakai will be given on the website. Please explore the tabs and get a sense of the organization.\n\n\nSakai\nSakai is a learning management system for higher ed. This is the university sanctioned LMS where we will submit assignments.\nYou will turn in assignments through Sakai under the “Submissions” tab. Generally, there will be a link to each assignment on the course website. You can also view your grades under “Gradebook” and links to Webex under “Webex.”\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment\nType of assessment\nBefore you submit/take it\nAfter it is graded\n\n\nHomework\nFormative\n\nWork out each problem on your own as much as you can\nTalk through problems with a peer\nGo to Office Hours for help\nWrite down work that shows your thought process\nSearch your issue on Stack Exchange/Stack Overflow\n\n\nReview the solutions\nReview your mistakes\nFor solutions that involve writing sentences, check with me or a TA if your answer fits the solution\nGo to Office Hours to ask about your solutions\n\n\n\nMidterm / Final Exam\nSummative\n\nIdentify and achieve learning objectives in each lecture\nUnderstand why certain statistics tools are used for certain cases\nPractice problems that you struggled with\nCome to Office Hours for help with specific problems or concepts\n\n\nReview the solutions\nReview your mistakes\nFor solutions that involve writing sentences, check with me or a TA if your answer fits the solution\nGo to Office Hours to ask about your solutions\nDo not ask for a regrade unless you have viewed the solutions\n\n\n\nClass Surveys\nN/A\n\nBring appropriate electronic device to participate in polls\nComplete the survey during the last 5 minutes of class or after class within 7 days\n\n\nReview muddiest and clearest points from the week\n\n\n\n\nIf you would like any other course resources explained in this format, please request it through the Ongoing Course Feedback."

    "text": "Course Policies and Resources\n\nLate Work Policy\nI encourage you to make your best effort to submit all assignments on time, but I understand circumstances arise that are beyond our control. Please see this Swansea University’s page on extenuating circumstances for some examples. Not all circumstances are covered here, so please reach out if you have questions. \n\nThe class will end on December 8, 2023. All coursework is expected to be completed by then. If you have extenuating circumstances, and need additional time to complete class assignments, please contact me. Together, we will come up with a plan for completion and to sort out registrar logistics.\nIf you have extenuating circumstances that may jeopardize your ability to do work for several weeks, please contact me. We will come up with a plan to keep you on track in the course and prevent any delay in your education.\nFor homework, there is a due date posted, but you may turn in the assignment any time before the class ends. I will give you the check regardless of when you submit the assignment. However, if you would like feedback on the homework, you must turn it in on time OR email me asking for feedback for your late homework.\nFor non-homework assignments, I ask you to email me directly. You can explain your circumstances and may ask me for an extension, but I won’t necessarily grant one.\nIf you have a emergency involving your self, family, pet, friend, classmate, or anything/one deemed important to you, please do not worry about immediately contacting me. We can work something out after your emergency. If I contact you during an emergency, it is only because I am worried, and you do NOT need to respond until you are able. \n\n\n\nRegrade Policy\nIf you think a question was incorrectly graded, first compare your answer to the answer key. If you believe a re-grade would be appropriate, write an email to me containing the question and a short explanation as to why the question(s) was/were incorrectly graded. Deadline: One week after assignments were returned to class (late requests will not be considered).\n\n\nAttendance Policy\nYou are expected to attend class and participate in-class polls and the exit ticket. For students who miss class or need a review, I will make video and audio recordings of lectures available. There are no guarantees against technical or other challenges for the recording availability or quality. For students who are unable to attend the class in-person and synchronously, viewing the recording within 7 days is acceptable. This is meant to keep you on track within the course and prevent a pile up of material. Make sure to complete the exit ticket to demonstrate attendance.\n\n\nPlagiarism and Attribution\nPlease note that this section has been motivated by Dr. Steven Bedrick’s Course Policies and Grading site for BMI 525. (Note that this is a good example of informal attribution of someone else’s work.)\nIn this class, it is easy to use ChatGPT or other AI tools to solve your homework for you. Many problems follow a basic structure that is especially easy for ChatGPT to solve. In this class, you may use ChatGPT to help with your homework. You may even ask for direct answers. However, there are a few things I do not want you to do:\n\nDo not copy ChatGPT’s answer directly into your homework. Your homework is graded for full credit if you turn it in, in any state, so turning in ChatGPT’s answers is unacceptable. I rather see half-written answers that show what you’re thinking than see a correct answer from ChatGPT.\nDo not stop once ChatGPT answered a question. If it gives an explanation, interact with it! Make sure you understand the thought process of ChatGPT. Try writing out the process to help cement it in your head. Check the answer with what we learn in class.\nDo not use ChatGPT on our exams! Hence, you need to really understand how to solve these problems even if you use ChatGPT on the homework.\n\nAt the end of the day, ChatGPT is a resource that will be available to you in a job and outside of school. Thus, we should use it as a tool in school as well! Let me know if ChatGPT helped you understand something! I would love to incorporate it into future classes!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou can think of this class as assembling a toolbox. When a handyperson starts working for the first time, they need to buy their tools. For their first few jobs, they might need help finding their tools or remembering which tool is best used for what action. Eventually, they get to know their tools well, and using them appropriately becomes second nature.\nFor now, ChatGPT can help us find and use our tools, but we need to work towards using them as second nature!"

Please talk to me before or after class or stop by my office if there is anything you want to discuss or about which you are unclear. I want to be supportive of your learning and growth.\nInclusive & supportive learning community\nI believe that learning happens best when we all learn together, as a community. This means creating a space characterized by generous listening, civility, humility, patience, and hospitality. I will attempt to promote a safe climate where we examine content from multiple cultural perspectives, and I will strive to create and maintain a classroom atmosphere in which you feel free to both listen to others and express your views and ask questions to increase your learning.\nOpenness to feedback\nI appreciate straightforward feedback from you regarding how well the class is meeting your needs. Let me know if material is not clear or when its relevance to the student learning outcomes for the course is not apparent. In particular, let me know if you identify bias or stereotyping in my teaching materials as I will seek to continuously improve. Please also let me know if there’s an aspect of the class you find particularly interesting, helpful, or enjoyable!\nResponsiveness\nI will monitor email as well as the discussion board daily and try respond to all messages within 24 hours Monday-Friday.\nClear guidelines and prompt feedback on assignments\nI will provide clear instructions for all assignments, and a grading rubric when applicable. I will provide detailed feedback on your submissions and will update grades promptly in Sakai.\n\n\nStudent Expectations and Resources\nAttend class\nYou are expected to attend all scheduled class meetings synchronously or watch the recording within 7 days. Attendance is taken through exit tickets. If you have issues accessing the poll on a specific day, please let me know. \nParticipate\nI encourage you to participate actively in class and online discussions. I will expect all students, and all instructors, to be respectful of each other’s contributions, whether I agree with them or not. Professional interactions are expected.\nBuild rapport\nIf you find that you have any trouble keeping up with assignments or other aspects of the course, make sure you let me know as early as possible. As you will find, building rapport and effective relationships are key to becoming an effective professional. Make sure that you are proactive in informing me when difficulties arise during the quarter so that I can help you find a solution.\nComplete assignments\nAll assignments for this course will be submitted electronically through Sakai unless otherwise instructed.  I encourage you to make your best effort to submit all assignments on time, but I understand that sometimes circumstances arise that are beyond our control. If you need an extension, please contact me in congruence with the Late Policy.\nSeek help if you need it\nI believe it is important to support the physical and emotional well‐being of my students. If you are experiencing physical or mental health issues, I encourage you to use the resources on campus such as those listed below. If you have a health issue that is affecting your performance or participation in the course, and/or if you need help connecting with these resources, please contact me.\n\nStudent Health and Wellness Center (SHW), Website, 503-494-8665 (OHSU Students only)\nStudent Health and Counseling (SHAC), Website, 503-725-2800\n\nInform your instructor of any accommodations needed\nYou should speak with or email me before or during the first week of classes regarding any special needs. Students seeking academic accommodations should register with the appropriate service under the School policies below.\nSome religious holidays may occur on regularly scheduled class days. Because available class hours are so limited in number, we will have to hold class on all such days. Class video recordings will be available and you are encouraged to engage with the material outside of the regular class time. You are also encouraged to come to office hours with questions from the session.\nCommit to integrity\nAs a student in this course (and at PSU or OHSU) you are expected to maintain high degrees of professionalism, commitment to active learning and participation in this class and also integrity in your behavior in and out of the classroom.\nCheating and other forms of academic misconduct will not be tolerated in this course and will be dealt with firmly. Student academic misconduct refers to behavior that includes plagiarism, cheating on assignments, fabrication of data, falsification of records or official documents, intentional misuse of equipment or materials (including library materials), or aiding and abetting the perpetration of such acts. Preparation of exams, assigned on an individual basis, must represent each student’s own individual effort. When used, resource materials should be cited in conventional reference format."

He was hired in 1954 after the department almost made him an offer in 1942 (but declined to do so when one faculty member’s wife said she didn’t want Blackwell hired because she wouldn’t feel comfortable having faculty events in her home with a black man).

    "text": "Muddiest Points\n\n1. Why is the number of possible events \\(2^{|S|}\\)?\nIn class, we were wondering why/if \\(2^{|S|}\\) is the general formula for calculating the total number of possible events. We were specifically wondering if the \\(2\\) came from the fact that we had two options (heads and tails) for our outcome. Let’s work through the example of a 6-sided die to explain this further. The sample space is \\(S=\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\). So is the total number of possible events \\(2^6\\) or \\(6^6\\) or something else? We can actually think about an event by using an indicator variable for each outcome of the sample space. An indicator variable is just a way to give us a yes/no answer to a question. So in this case, we are wondering: is this outcome a part of our event? If our event is \\(\\{1\\}\\) then for the outcome \\(1\\), the answer is “yes, the outcome is part of the event. For outcomes \\(2-6\\), the answer is”no, the outcome is not apart of the event.”\n\nFor each outcome, we have a “yes” or “no” answer. We can look at another example of an event. Let’s say our event is rolling an even number:\n\nFor \\(2\\), \\(4\\), and \\(6\\), the answer is “yes.” We can define the indicator variable for whether an outcome is in an event or not. The indicator gives a 1 or 0 for yes and no respectively.\n\nAs stated above, the \\(2\\) in \\(2^6\\) comes from the \\(2\\) options from our indicator. Each side has two options, and there are \\(6\\) sides. Thus, \\(2^6\\) possible events.\n\n\n2. What is an event??\nI think this will become clearer when we start thinking about events in the context of probability. When we think of events outside of probability, we may think of something we actually do or something that happens, like going to a concert or coming to class or missing the streetcar. In this case, we think of the event as the single thing (out of all the options) that actually occured. For example, if I’m taking the streetcar to class, I can think of two definitive options of what might occur: I miss the streetcar or I get on the streetcar. Only one of these things can occur, which I may call an event colloquially.\nIt is important to make the distinction with events defined within probability. Events are not necessarily a single thing that occurred. Instead it can be a collection of things that may occur. In the example of the streetcar, I can define my event to include both options. Thus, my event is that I make the streetcar or I miss it. Both of these things cannot happen simultaneously, but if I want to calculate the probability that I miss or make the streetcar, then it is helpful to have the event defined."

Both of these things cannot happen simultaneously, but if I want to calculate the probability that I miss or make the streetcar, then it is helpful to have the event defined.\n\n\n3. Confusion on the Venn Diagram for the high blood pressure example\nThis is in reference to the Chapter 1 notes on “BP example variation (3/3)” slide. I explained the event that at least one subject does not have high blood pressure using a venn diagram. In this venn diagram, I assumed \\(n=4\\), and I wanted to show that the union of complements is equal to the complement of unions: \\(\\bigcup\\limits_{i=1}^{n}H_i^C = \\Big(\\bigcap\\limits_{i=1}^{n}H_i\\Big)^C\\).\n\n Now we can look at \\(\\bigcup\\limits_{i=1}^{4}H_i^C\\). We first need to define \\(H_i^c\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Proofs of propositions\nFurther explanations of the propositions can be found in the textbook from pages 24-27. For many of the explanations in class, I was working to produce a union of disjoint events, so that the probability could easily be calculated. Proposition 3 and 4 were specifically mentioned, so I will include some writing notes on them here:\n\nProposition 3\nIf \\(A \\subseteq B\\), then \\(\\mathbb{P}(A) \\leq \\mathbb{P}(B)\\)\nIn this proposition, I want to define event \\(B\\) as a union of disjoint events so that I can show \\(P(B)\\) is the sum of \\(P(A)\\) and some greater-than-or-equal-to 0 probability event. If the following is my venn diagram of A and B:\n\n\n\n\n\nThen I can define B as the union of disjoint events: \nIf we then take the probability of each side of the equation \\(B = A \\cup (A^c \\cap B)\\), we get \\[P(B) = P\\big(A \\cup (A^c \\cap B)\\big)\\]\nSince events \\(A\\) and \\(A^c \\cap B\\) are disjoint, the probability of their union is just: \\[P(A) + P(A^c \\cap B)\\]\nThus, our equation is now \\[P(B) = P(A) + P(A^c \\cap B)\\]\nFrom Axiom 1, we know for event \\(A^c \\cap B\\), \\(P(A^c \\cap B) \\geq 0\\).\nSo the probability of event B is the sum of the probability of event A and an event that is \\(\\geq\\) 0. This means \\(P(B) \\geq P(A)\\).\n\n\nProposition 4\n\\(\\mathbb{P}(A \\cup B) = \\mathbb{P}(A) + \\mathbb{P}(B) - \\mathbb{P}(A \\cap B)\\)\n\n\nFrom the pictures above, we can see some similar disjoint events.\nIf we look back at \\(A \\cup B\\), we can start manipulating the right side of the equation:\n\n \n\n\n\n5. Example at end of Chapter 2 slides (Venn Diagram)\nI will post this in the previous week’s Muddy Points as well. Please follow this link for my work through of the example. And here is the PDF with my work.\nSub-question: why don’t we just multiply the probability of A and B to get the intersection? This is a specific property of probability when A and B are independent. Only when A and B are independent can we conclude that \\(P(A \\cap B) = P(A)P(B)\\).\n\n\n6. Partition of events\nWe’ve been working with event partitions throughout Chapter 2, but we have not formally identified them. Partitions are advantageous to define for two reasons:\n\nThe partitions may be easier to calculate. We can then use the partitions to reconstruct other probabilities that may be more difficult to calculate\nPartitions have nice properties as a consequence of being disjoint. For example, the probability of the union of partitions is the sum of the probabilities across each partition: \\[P\\bigg(\\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\\bigg) = P(A_1)P(A_2)P(A_3) \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot P(A_n)\\]"

    "text": "Muddiest Points\n\n1. Example at end of Chapter 2 slides (Venn Diagram)\nI will post this in the previous week’s Muddy Points as well. Please follow this link for my work through of the example. And here is the PDF with my work.\nSub-question: why don’t we just multiply the probability of A and B to get the intersection? This is a specific property of probability when A and B are independent. Only when A and B are independent can we conclude that \\(P(A \\cap B) = P(A)P(B)\\).\n\n\n2. Partition of events\nWe’ve been working with event partitions throughout Chapter 2, but we have not formally identified them. Partitions are advantageous to define for two reasons:\n\nThe partitions may be easier to calculate. We can then use the partitions to reconstruct other probabilities that may be more difficult to calculate\nPartitions have nice properties as a consequence of being disjoint. For example, the probability of the union of partitions is the sum of the probabilities across each partition: \\[P\\bigg(\\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\\bigg) = P(A_1)P(A_2)P(A_3) \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot P(A_n)\\]\n\n\n\n3. Order matters vs. order does not matter\nI think the best way to think about when order does and does not matter is through examples. So here is another example:\n\nI randomly select 3 different people to be on my committee from a larger group of 5 people (we’ll call them people A-E) …\n\nOrder matters: If I want to assign each person to a specific role as I select them, then I want to keep track of the order\nOrder does not matter: If I just want to assemble a committee without any hierarchy, then the order that I select them does not matter\n\nSo if I pick person A first, second, or third, they are still on the committee\n\n\n\nWhen order matters, the seats are now labelled as president, vice president, and treasurer:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen order does not matter, there are just three seats to fill:\n\n\n\n\n\nFor both situations, let’s say you pick person A, C, and E. When order matters, we can arrange these three people in a few ways:\n\n\n\n\n\nSo there are 6 ways to order the three people.\nWhen order does not matter, then we just need to know that person A, E, and C are on the committee:\n\n\n\n\n\n**Remember that there are 6 permutations to this 1 combination\nLet’s answer more questions with this example…\n\nWhen order does not matter, what are we controlling for?\nIn class example 1.3 and 1.4, we went from an example where order matters to one where order does not matter. So I showed us going from a calculation of \\(\\dfrac{10!}{4!}\\) ways to order them to \\(\\dfrac{10!}{4!6!}\\) ways of choosing 6 subjects. So why do we divide by \\(6!\\) when order does not matter? Let’s think back to our three committee seats. For the three seats, and person A, C, and E selected, there were 6 ways to order them. In fact, for any three people selected, there is always 6 ways to arrange (order) them into the positions. We can calculate the number of ways to arrange them with another permutation: if given three people and three seats, we can arrange them in \\(3\\cdot2\\cdot1=6\\) ways because we have three options for president, then once the president is selected, we only have 2 options for VP, then 1 for treasurer. So for every 6 ways to order the three people, there is only one way to select them unordered. Thus, we divide the number of ordered options by the number of ways each group of three people can be ordered.\nSo the calculation for the ordered committee (with P, VP, and T) is:\n\n\n\n\n\nwhich is 60 ways to fill the committee seats when order (arrangement) matters.\nAnd the calculation for the unordered (order does not matter) committee will divide the ordered permutations by the number of ways to order within the three seats:\n\n\n\n\n\nwhich is 10 ways to fill the seats when order does not matter.\n\n\nIs the probability equal when order matters and when order does not matter?\nYes and no…\nIn the example with the spades, for order does not matter, we saw that \\(r!\\) cancels out and leaves us with a probability equal to when order does matter! This is because each spade is not distinguishable from the other. (Yes, technically each will have a different face, but we only care about the suit.) If we select a spade first then another spade, all we know of the order is spade first, spade second. If we flip that, we still get spade first, spade second. Thus, the order of the spades does not matter.\nIn the spades problem, we distinguished between “order matters” and “order does not matter” but the way we defined the probability, and the fact that spades are indistinguishable, means that the “ordered” cards really did not matter. It’ll definitely matter in an event where we get the first card as a spade and the second as a heart. We can no longer use combinations to define the event space!\nThe main take away should be that the probabilities (using order matters and order does not matter) are equal when order is not needed to define the event! When order does not matter, it can still be easier to calculate the probability using an “order matters” framework!! So we will use that to our advantage!\nBelow is some of the work demonstrating the probabilities loosely mentioned. Please note that ChatGPT could be a really helpful tool if you are curious about this question!\n\n\n\n\n\nI’ll leave the work to calculate the exact probabilities above. For Case #1, the probabilities are equal. For Case #2, the probabilities are not equal!\n\n\n\n4. Disjoint vs. Independent Events\nHere is a pretty good video breaking down disjoint (mutually exclusive) events and independent events. It includes examples as well.\n\n\n5. Conditional Probability Fact #4\nHere is the 4th Conditional Probability Fact:\n\\(\\mathbb{P}(A|B)\\) is a probability, meaning that it satisfies the probability axioms. In particular, \\[\\mathbb{P}(A|B) + \\mathbb{P}(A^C|B) = 1\\] This is true even if A and B are NOT independent. Let me show you…\nWe can start by \\(P(B)\\) as the union of two disjoint events that involve \\(A\\) and \\(A^c\\):\n\\[\nP(B) = P((A \\cap B) \\cup (A^c \\cap B))\n\\]\nBecause they are disjoint, we can use Axiom 3 to say they are just the sum of each probability:\n\\[\nP(B) = P(A \\cap B) + P(A^c \\cap B)\n\\]\nNow, we can divide both side of the equation by \\(P(B)\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\dfrac{P(B)}{P(B)} = & \\dfrac{P(A \\cap B) + P(A^c \\cap B)}{P(B)} \\\\\n1 = & \\dfrac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} + \\dfrac{P(A^c \\cap B)}{P(B)} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nBy our definition of conditional probability, we know \\(P(A|B) = \\dfrac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}\\) and \\(P(A^c|B) = \\dfrac{P(A^c \\cap B)}{P(B)}\\) Thus,\n\\[\n1 = P(A|B) + P(A^c|B)\n\\]\nAgain, this is true even if A and B are NOT independent!"

Wainwright, Near-optimal inference in adaptive linear regression\n\n\nWhen data is collected in an adaptive manner, even simple methods like ordinary least squares can exhibit non-normal asymptotic behavior. As an undesirable consequence, hypothesis tests and confidence intervals based on asymptotic normality can lead to erroneous results. We propose a family of online debiasing estimators to correct these distributional anomalies in least squares estimation. Our proposed methods take advantage of the covariance structure present in the dataset and provide sharper estimates in directions for which more information has accrued. We establish an asymptotic normality property for our proposed online debiasing estimators under mild conditions on the data collection process and provide asymptotically exact confidence intervals…\n\n\nPierre Bayle, Alexandre Bayle, Lucas Janson, and Lester Mackey, Cross-validation Confidence Intervals for Test Error Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), December 2020.\n\n\nThis work develops central limit theorems for cross-validation and consistent estimators of its asymptotic variance under weak stability conditions on the learning algorithm. Together, these results provide practical, asymptotically-exact confidence intervals for k-fold test error and valid, powerful hypothesis tests of whether one learning algorithm has smaller k-fold test error than another. These results are also the first of their kind for the popular choice of leave-one-out cross-validation. In our real-data experiments with diverse learning algorithms, the resulting intervals and tests outperform the most popular alternative methods from the literature…\n\n\n\nOutside links\n\nMathematically Gifted & Black\nLinkedin\npersonal\n\n\n\nOther\nThe precursor to kaggle was a $1 million prize given by Netflix to the most accurate prediction of ratings that people give to the movies they watch.

They not only speak to the progress that had been made, but they centered many of the challenges that continued to exist at the time. The set of visualizations demonstrate how powerfully a picture can tell 1000 words, as the information Du Bois used was primarily available from public records (e.g., census and other government reports).\nWhitney Battle-Baptiste and Britt Rusert have reproduced and narrated the images from the exhibit in W.E.B.

Through that class he found his way to two different summer REU programs and eventually to a PhD in Applied Mathematics from Iowa State University (2018). While initially believing that he would stay in academia after his graduate work, being introduced to machine learning methods caused him to pursue data science jobs after graduation.\nDr. Dairyko served as a Senior Manager of Data Science at the Milwaukee Brewers and is now the Director of Ticketing Analytics at the Milwaukee Bucks. Helping the organization get the most out of budgeting, revenue, and ticket sales allows him to fully use his training in mathematics and data science.\n\n\n\nTopics covered\nDr. Dairyko’s graduate work is in graph theory, in particular, exponential domination. In a graph, exponential domination is the extent to which a particular vertex influences the remaining vertices in a graph. His published work falls very much within the realm of mathematics, proving that particular properties of graphs exist. However, graph theory is intimately related to machine learning; for example, it is the foundational structure of a neural network. Understanding properties of graphs help data scientists develop even more powerful models to harness information from data.\n\n\nRelevant work\n\nM.

In particular, she was admant about the importance of hygiene and sanitary conditions. She was born into a wealthy and well-connected family and had a large amount of privilege. Educated by her father, she showed an ability toward making analytic arguments at an early age. For her work, she was awarded the Royal Red Cross, the Lady of Grace of the Order of St John, and the Order of Merit.\n\n\n\nTopics covered\nNightingale was a nurse and statistician who used her analytic abilities to better understand and improve public health. She served in the Crimean War where Britain and France fought against the Russian invasion of the Ottoman Empire. Nightingale worked to convince Queen Victoria that poor sanitation and overcrowding were causing unnecessary death. She was able to show, for example, that peacetime soldiers (who lived in poorly kept barracks) were dying in much higher number than comparable civilian men. Her genius was to collect data meticulously and to display it in ways that were accessible to the general public. Her visualizations are lauded as pioneering and the first of their kind to tell effective stories of important issues.\n\n\nRelevant work\n\nRJ Andrews, “Florence Nightingale’s Data Revolution” in Scientific American 327, 2, 78-85, 2022. doi:10.1038/scientificamerican0822-78,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Diagram of the causes of mortality in the army in the East” was published in Notes on Matters Affecting the Health, Efficiency, and Hospital Administration of the British Army and sent to Queen Victoria in 1858.\n\n\n\n\n\nS Julious, “On the battlefields of the Crimean War and in the hills of Sheffield, Florence Nightingale’s legacy lives on”, The Tribune, Feb 17, 2023.\n\n\n\nOutside links\n\nWikipedia"

    "text": "Some remarks on random variables\n\nA random variable’s value is completely determined by the outcome \\(\\omega\\), where \\(\\omega \\in S\\). What is random is the outcome \\(\\omega\\).\nA random variable is a function from the sample space (with outcomes \\(\\omega\\)) to the set of real numbers\n\nWe typically write \\(X\\) instead of \\(X(\\omega)\\), where \\(X\\) is our random variable\n\nFor example, if we roll three dice, there are \\(6^3 = 216\\) possible outcomes (which is \\(\\omega\\)). We can define a random variable as the sum of the of the three dice. If our outcome is the set of numbers the dice landed on ( \\(\\omega=(a,b,c)\\) ), then \\(X(\\omega) = X = a + b + c\\)."
