## Let's remind ourselves of the model that we fit last lesson

## Fitted line is derived from the population SLR model

 

The (population) regression model is denoted by:

::: heq
$$Y =  \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \epsilon$$
:::

-   $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are **unknown** population parameters

-   $\epsilon$ (epsilon) is the error about the line

    -   It is assumed to be a random variable with a...

        -   Normal distribution with mean 0 and constant variance
            $\sigma^2$

        -   i.e. $\epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$

## Poll Everywhere Question 1

# Learning Objectives

::: lob
1.  Estimate the variance of the residuals
:::

2.  Using a hypothesis test, determine if there is enough evidence that
    population slope $\beta_1$ is not 0 (applies to $\beta_0$ as well)
3.  Calculate and report the estimate and confidence interval for the
    population slope $\beta_1$ (applies to $\beta_0$ as well)
4.  Calculate and report the estimate and confidence interval for the
    expected/mean response given $X$

## $\widehat\sigma^2$: Needed ingredient for inference

-   Recall our population model residuals are distributed by
    $\epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$
    -   And our estimated residuals are
        $\widehat\epsilon \sim N(0, \widehat\sigma^2)$
-   Hence, the *variance* of the errors (residuals) is estimated by
    $\widehat{\sigma}^2$

::: heq
$$\widehat{\sigma}^2 = S_{y|x}^2= \frac{1}{n-2}\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \widehat{Y}_i)^2 =\frac{1}{n-2}SSE = MSE$$
:::

## $\widehat\sigma^2$: I hope R can calculate that for me...

-   The *standard deviation* $\widehat{\sigma}$ is given in the R output
    as the `Residual standard error`

    -   $4^{th}$ line from the bottom in the `summary()` output of the
        model:

```{r}
(m1_sum = summary(model1))
m1_sum$sigma
# number of observations (pairs of data) used to run the model
nobs(model1) 
```

## $\widehat\sigma^2$ to SSE

-   Recall how we minimized the SSE to find our line of best fit
-   SSE and $\widehat\sigma^2$ are closely related:

$$\begin{aligned}
\widehat{\sigma}^2 & = \frac{1}{n-2}SSE\\
6.142^2 & = \frac{1}{80-2}SSE\\
SSE & = 78 \cdot 6.142^2 = 2942.48 
\end{aligned}$$

-   2942.48 is the smallest sums of squares of all possible regression
    lines through the data

# Learning Objectives

        the population slope $\beta_1$ (applies to $\beta_0$ as well)
:::

4.  Calculate and report the estimate and confidence interval for the
    expected/mean response given $X$

## Do we trust our estimate $\widehat\beta_1$?

-   So far, we have shown that we think the estimate is 0.232  
-   $\widehat\beta_1$ uses our sample data to estimate the population
    parameter $\beta_1$  
-   Inference helps us figure out ~mathematically~ how much we trust our
    best-fit line  
-   Are we certain that the relationship between $X$ and $Y$ that we
    estimated reflects the true, underlying relationship?

## Steps in hypothesis testing

## General steps for hypothesis test for population **slope** $\beta_1$ (t-test)

    assumptions (checked in our Model Evaluation step)
:::
:::

::: highlight-container
::: highlight
2.  State the null hypothesis.
:::
:::

Often, we are curious if the coefficient is 0 or not:

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
H_0 &: \beta_1 = 0\\
\text{vs. } H_A&: \beta_1 \neq 0
\end{align}
```
::: highlight-container
::: highlight
3.  Specify the significance level.
:::
:::

Often we use $\alpha = 0.05$

::: highlight-container
::: highlight
4.  Specify the test statistic and its distribution under the null
:::
:::

The test statistic is $t$, and follows a Student's t-distribution.
:::

::: {.column width="4%"}
:::

::: {.column width="48%"}
::: highlight-container
::: highlight
5.  Compute the value of the test statistic
:::
:::

The calculated **test statistic** for $\widehat\beta_1$ is

$$t = \frac{ \widehat\beta_1 - \beta_1}{ \text{SE}_{\widehat\beta_1}} = \frac{ \widehat\beta_1}{ \text{SE}_{\widehat\beta_1}}$$

when we assume $H_0: \beta_1 = 0$ is true.

::: highlight-container
::: highlight
6.  Calculate the p-value
:::
:::

We are generally calculating: $2\cdot P(T > t)$

::: highlight-container
::: highlight
7.  Write conclusion for hypothesis test
:::
:::

We (reject/fail to reject) the null hypothesis that the slope is 0 at
the $100\alpha\%$ significiance level. There is
(sufficient/insufficient) evidence that there is significant association
between ($Y$) and ($X$) (p-value = $P(T > t)$).

## Calculating standard error for $\widehat\beta_1$ (1/2)

```{r}
glance(model1)

# standard deviation of the residuals (Residual standard error in summary() output)
(s_resid <- glance(model1)$sigma)

# standard deviation of x's
(s_x <- sd(gapm$female_literacy_rate_2011, na.rm=T))

# number of pairs of complete observations
(n <- nobs(model1))

(se_b1 <- s_resid/(s_x * sqrt(n-1))) # compare to SE in regression output
```

## Calculating standard error for $\widehat\beta_1$ (2/2)

![](pause.png){.absolute top="1%" right="0%" width="120" height="120"}

-   **Option 2:** Use regression table

```{r}
# recall model1_b1 is regression table restricted to b1 row
model1_b1 <-tidy(model1) %>% filter(term == "female_literacy_rate_2011")
model1_b1 %>% gt() %>%
  tab_options(table.font.size = 45) %>% fmt_number(decimals = 4)
```

## Some important notes

-   Today we are discussing the hypothesis test for a **single**
    coefficient

 

-   The test statistic for a single coefficient follows a Student's
    t-distribution

     

    -   It can also follow an F-distribution, but we will discuss this
        more with multiple linear regression and multi-level categorical
        covariates

 

-   Single coefficient testing can be done on any coefficient, but it is
    most useful for continuous covariates or binary covariates

     

    -   This is because testing the single coefficient will still tell
        us something about the overall relationship between the
        covariate and the outcome

     

    -   We will talk more about this with multiple linear regression and
        multi-level categorical covariates

## Poll Everywhere Question 3

## Life expectancy example: hypothesis test for population **slope** $\beta_1$ (1/4)

-   Steps 1-4 are setting up our hypothesis test: not much change from
    the general steps

    assumptions (checked in our Model Evaluation step)
:::
:::

::: highlight-container
::: highlight
2.  State the null hypothesis.
:::
:::

We are testing if the slope is 0 or not:

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
H_0 &: \beta_1 = 0\\
\text{vs. } H_A&: \beta_1 \neq 0
\end{align}

## Life expectancy example: hypothesis test for population **slope** $\beta_1$ (2/4)

::: highlight-container

5.  Compute the value of the test statistic
:::
:::

-   **Option 1:** Calculate the test statistic using the values in the
    regression table

```{r}
# recall model1_b1 is regression table restricted to b1 row
model1_b1 <-tidy(model1) %>% filter(term == "female_literacy_rate_2011")
model1_b1 %>% gt() %>%
  tab_options(table.font.size = 40) %>% fmt_number(decimals = 2)
(TestStat_b1 <- model1_b1$estimate / model1_b1$std.error)
```

-   **Option 2:** Get the test statistic value ($t^*$) from `R`

```{r}
model1_b1 %>% gt() %>%
  tab_options(table.font.size = 40) %>% fmt_number(decimals = 2)
```

## Life expectancy example: hypothesis test for population **slope** $\beta_1$ (3/4)

::: highlight-container
::: highlight
6.  Calculate the p-value
:::
:::

-   The $p$-value is the *probability of obtaining a test statistic*
    **just as extreme or more extreme** *than the **observed** test
    statistic assuming the null hypothesis* $H_0$ *is true*

-   We know the probability distribution of the test statistic (the
    *null distribution*) assuming $H_0$ is true

-   Statistical theory tells us that the test statistic $t$ can be
    modeled by a $t$-distribution with $df = n-2$.

    -   We had 80 countries' data, so $n=80$

-   **Option 1:** Use `pt()` and our calculated test statistic

```{r}
(pv = 2*pt(TestStat_b1, df=80-2, lower.tail=F))
```

-   **Option 2:** Use the regression table output

```{r}
model1_b1 %>% gt() %>%
  tab_options(table.font.size = 40)
```

## Life expectancy example: hypothesis test for population **slope** $\beta_1$ (4/4)

::: highlight-container
::: highlight
7.  Write conclusion for the hypothesis test
:::
:::

We reject the null hypothesis that the slope is 0 at the $5\%$
significance level. There is sufficient evidence that there is
significant association between female life expectancy and female
literacy rates (p-value \< 0.0001).

## Note on hypothesis testing using `R`

-   We can basically skip Step 5 if we are using the "Option 2" route

 

-   In our assignments: if you use Option 2, Step 5 is optional

    -   Unless I specifically ask for the test statistic!!

## Life expectancy ex: hypothesis test for population **intercept** $\beta_0$ (1/4)

-   Steps 1-4 are setting up our hypothesis test: not much change from
    the general steps

::: highlight-container
::: highlight
1.  For today's class, we are assuming that we have met the underlying
    assumptions (checked in our Model Evaluation step)
:::
:::

::: highlight-container

2.  State the null hypothesis.
:::
:::

We are testing if the intercept is 0 or not:

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
H_0 &: \beta_0 = 0\\
\text{vs. } H_A&: \beta_0 \neq 0
\end{align}
```

3.  Specify the significance level
:::
:::

Often we use $\alpha = 0.05$

::: highlight-container
::: highlight
4.  Specify the test statistic and its distribution under the null

:::

This is the same as the slope. The test statistic is $t$, and follows a
Student's t-distribution.

## Life expectancy ex: hypothesis test for population **intercept** $\beta_0$ (2/4)

::: highlight-container
::: highlight
5.  Compute the value of the test statistic
:::
:::

-   **Option 1:** Calculate the test statistic using the values in the
    regression table

```{r}
# recall model1_b1 is regression table restricted to b1 row
model1_b0 <-tidy(model1) %>% filter(term == "(Intercept)")
model1_b0 %>% gt() %>%
  tab_options(table.font.size = 40) %>% fmt_number(decimals = 2)
(TestStat_b0 <- model1_b0$estimate / model1_b0$std.error)
```

-   **Option 2:** Get the test statistic value ($t^*$) from `R`

```{r}
model1_b0 %>% gt() %>%
  tab_options(table.font.size = 40) %>% fmt_number(decimals = 2)
```

```{r}
model1_b0 %>% gt() %>%

```

## Life expectancy ex: hypothesis test for population **intercept** $\beta_0$ (4/4)

::: highlight-container
::: highlight
7.  Write conclusion for the hypothesis test
:::
:::

We reject the null hypothesis that the intercept is 0 at the $5\%$
significance level. There is sufficient evidence that the intercept for
the association between average female life expectancy and female
literacy rates is different from 0 (p-value \< 0.0001).

   

-   Note: if we fail to reject $H_0$, then we could decide to remove the
    intercept from the model to force the regression line to go through
    the origin (0,0) if it makes sense to do so for the application.

## Confidence interval for population **slope** $\beta_1$

Recall the general CI formula:

$$\widehat{\beta}_1 \pm t_{\alpha, n-2}^* \cdot SE_{\widehat{\beta}_1}$$

To construct the confidence interval, we need to:

-   Set our $\alpha$-level

-   Find $\widehat\beta_1$

-   Calculate the $t_{n-2}^*$

-   Calculate $SE_{\widehat{\beta}_1}$

    them our full hypothesis test

    -   In an informal setting, someone may want to see it

-   Typically, we report the estimate with the confidence interval

    -   From the confidence interval, your audience can also deduce the
        results of a hypothesis test

-   Once we found our CI, we often just write the interpretation of the
    coefficient estimate:

::: definition
::: def-title
General statement for population slope inference
:::

::: def-cont
For every increase of 1 unit in the $X$-variable, there is an expected
average increase of $\widehat\beta_1$ units in the $Y$-variable (95%:
LB, UB).
:::
:::

-   **In our example:** For every 1% increase in female literacy rate,
    the average life expectancy is expected to increase, on average,
    0.232 years (95% CI: 0.170, 0.295).

## Poll Everywhere Question 4

## For reference: quick CI for $\beta_0$

-   Calculate CI for population **intercept** $\beta_0$:
    $\widehat{\beta}_0 \pm t^*\cdot SE_{\beta_0}$

where $t^*$ is the $t$-distribution critical value with $df = n -2$

-   Use the regression table

```{r}
tidy(model1, conf.int = T) %>% gt() %>%
  tab_options(table.font.size = 40) %>% fmt_number(decimals = 3)
```

::: definition
::: def-title
General statement for population intercept inference
:::

::: def-cont
The expected outcome for the $Y$-variable is ($\widehat\beta_0$) when
the $X$-variable is 0 (95% CI: LB, UB).
:::
:::

-   **For example:** The expected/average life expectancy is 50.9 years
    when the female literacy rate is 0 (95% CI: 45.63, 56.22).

# Learning Objectives

1.  Estimate the variance of the residuals
2.  Using a hypothesis test, determine if there is enough evidence that
    population slope $\beta_1$ is not 0 (applies to $\beta_0$ as well)
3.  Calculate and report the estimate and confidence interval for the
    population slope $\beta_1$ (applies to $\beta_0$ as well)

::: lob
4.  Calculate and report the estimate and confidence interval for the
    expected/mean response given $X$

## Finding a mean response given a value of our independent variable

```{r}
#| echo: false
tidy(model1) %>% gt() %>%
  tab_options(table.font.size = 40) %>% fmt_number(decimals = 3)
```

$$\widehat{\textrm{life expectancy}} = 50.9 + 0.232 \cdot \textrm{female literacy rate} $$

-   What is the expected/predicted life expectancy for a country with
    female literacy rate 60%?

$$\widehat{\textrm{life expectancy}} = 50.9 + 0.232 \cdot 60 = `r 50.9 + 0.232*60`$$

```{r}
(y_60 <- 50.9 + 0.232*60)
```

-   How do we interpret the expected value?

    -   We sometimes call this "predicted" value, since we can
        technically use a literacy rate that is not in our sample

-   How variable is it?

## Mean response/prediction with regression line

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
Recall the population model:

*line + random "noise"*

$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot X + \varepsilon$$ with
$\varepsilon \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$

<br>

-   When we take the expected value, at a given value $X^*$, the average
    expected response at $X^*$ is:

$$\widehat{E}[Y|X^*] = \widehat\beta_0 + \widehat\beta_1 X^*$$

#| fig.width: 8.0
ggplot(gapm, aes(x = female_literacy_rate_2011,
                 y = life_expectancy_years_2011)) +

  geom_vline(xintercept = 60, color = "#A7EA52", size = 3)
```
:::
:::

-   These are the points on the regression line
-   The mean responses have variability, and we can calculate a CI for
    it, for every value of $X^*$

## CI for population mean response ($E[Y|X^*]$ or $\mu_{Y|X^*})$

$$\widehat{E}[Y|X^*] \pm t_{n-2}^* \cdot SE_{\widehat{E}[Y|X^*]}$$

$$SE_{\widehat{E}[Y|X^*]} = s_{\text{residuals}} \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} + \frac{(X^* - \overline{X})^2}{(n-1)s_X^2}}$$

-   $\widehat{E}[Y|X^*]$ is the predicted value at the specified point
    $X^*$ of the explanatory variable
-   $s_{\textrm{residuals}}^2$ is the sd of the residuals
-   $n$ is the sample size, or the number of (complete) pairs of points
-   $\overline{X}$ is the sample mean of the explanatory variable $x$
-   $s_X$ is the sample sd of the explanatory variable $X$

<br>

-   Recall that $t_{n-2}^*$ is calculated using `qt()` and depends on
    the confidence level ($1-\alpha$)

## Example Option 2: CI for mean response $\mu_{Y|X^*}$

**Find the 95% CI's for the mean life expectancy when the female
literacy rate is 60 and 80.**

-   Use the base R `predict()` function
-   Requires specification of a `newdata` "value"
    -   The `newdata` value is $X^*$
    -   This has to be in the format of a data frame though
    -   with column name identical to the predictor variable in the
        model

```{r}
newdata <- data.frame(female_literacy_rate_2011 = c(60, 80)) 
newdata
```

## Poll Everywhere Question 5


## Confidence bands for mean response $\mu_{Y|X^*}$

-   Often we plot the CI for many values of X, creating **confidence
    bands**
-   The confidence bands are what ggplot creates when we set `se = TRUE`
    within `geom_smooth`
-   Think about it: for what values of X are the confidence bands
    (intervals) narrowest?

```{r}
#| fig-align: center

ggplot(gapm,
       aes(x=female_literacy_rate_2011, 
           y=life_expectancy_years_2011)) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se=TRUE)+
  ggtitle("Life expectancy vs. female literacy rate") 
```

## Width of confidence bands for mean response $\mu_{Y|X^*}$

-   For what values of $X^*$ are the confidence bands (intervals)
    narrowest? widest?

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\widehat{E}[Y|X^*] &\pm t_{n-2}^* \cdot SE_{\widehat{E}[Y|X^*]}\\
\widehat{E}[Y|X^*] &\pm t_{n-2}^* \cdot s_{residuals} \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} + \frac{(X^* - \bar{x})^2}{(n-1)s_x^2}}
\end{align}
```
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center

ggplot(gapm, aes(x = female_literacy_rate_2011,
                 y = life_expectancy_years_2011)) +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, size = 3, colour="#F14124") +
  labs(x = "Female literacy rate (%)", 
       y = "Life expectancy (years)",
       title = "Relationship between life expectancy and female literacy rate in 2011") +
    theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 20), 
        axis.text = element_text(size = 20), 
        title = element_text(size = 17)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mx, color = "purple", size = 3)
