::: def-cont
**This is my first time teaching the course.** I will work hard to answer your questions in class, but I will often need some time outside of class to make sure I give you the best answer possible! Also, many of the examples are not my own. I will work to improve examples, but if you have feedback or suggestions, I am happy to hear them!
