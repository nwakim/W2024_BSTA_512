## Learning Objectives

1.  Calculate the mean (expected value) of discrete random variables

## Our good and fair friend, the 6-sided die

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
::: example
::: ex-title
Example 1
:::

::: ex-cont
Suppose you roll a fair 6-sided die. What value do you expect to get?
:::
:::
:::
:::

## What is an expected value?

::: definition
::: def-title
Definition: Expected value
:::

::: def-cont
The **expected value** of a discrete r.v. $X$ that takes on values $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ is $$\mathbb{E}[X] = \sum_{i=1}^n x_ip_X(x_i).$$
:::
:::

-   Expected values are not necessarily an actual outcome
    -   In previous example, we cannot roll a 3.5
    -   It could be that our expected value is not in the sample space ($E(X) \notin S$)
-   Definition holds when $X$ takes on countably infinitely many values (think $n=\infty$)

## Our good and not-so-fair friend, the 6-sided die

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
::: example
::: ex-title
Example 2
:::

::: ex-cont
Suppose the die is 6-sided, but not fair. And the probabilities of each side is distributed as:

| $x$ | $p_X(x)$ |
|-----|----------|
| 1   | 0.10     |
| 2   | 0.05     |
| 3   | 0.02     |
| 4   | 0.30     |
| 5   | 0.50     |
| 6   | 0.03     |

What value do you expect to get on a roll?

## Expected value of a Bernoulli distribution

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: example
::: ex-title
Example 3
:::

::: ex-cont
Suppose $$X = \left\{
        \begin{array}{ll}
            1 & \quad \mathrm{with\ probability}\ p \quad\mathrm{(success)}\\
            0 & \quad \mathrm{with\ probability}\ 1-p \quad\mathrm{(failure)}
        \end{array}
    \right.$$ Find the expected value of $X$.

## Let's slightly change our random variable

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
::: example
::: ex-title
Example 5
:::

::: ex-cont
Suppose $$X = \left\{
        \begin{array}{ll}
            1 & \quad \mathrm{with\ probability}\ p \\
            -1 & \quad \mathrm{with\ probability}\ 1-p 
        \end{array}
    \right.$$ Find the expected value of $X$.

## Bullseye! 🎯 {visibility="hidden"}

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
::: example
::: ex-title
Example 5
:::

::: ex-cont
Suppose I throw darts at a dartboard until I hit the bullseye, and that my probability of hitting the bullseye is $p$. Suppose further that all of my throws are independent, and that the probability of a bullseye never changes, no matter how many times I throw a dart. How many times should I expect to have to throw the dart until I hit the bullseye?

## Ghost! 👻

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
::: example
::: ex-title
Example 6
:::

::: ex-cont
A ghost is trick-or-treating. It comes to a house where it is known that there are 30 candies in the bag and only one is a watermelon Jolly Rancher, which is the ghost's favorite. The ghost takes pieces of candy without replacement until it gets the watermelon Jolly Rancher. How many pieces of candy do we expect the ghost to take?

## Some remarks on last two examples {visibility="hidden"}

Both examples are repeated random processes. They are fundamentally different though:

-   The bullseye example is "*with replacement*" since the probability of success remains constant.

-   The ghost trick-or-treating example is *without replacement*, and thus the probability of success changes with each trial.
