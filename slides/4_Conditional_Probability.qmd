Example 4.1

::: ex-cont
Suppose we randomly draw 2 cards from a standard deck of cards. What is the probability that both cards are spades?
:::
:::

**Solution:** Let

-   Let $A =$ event $1^{st}$ card is spades

-   Let $B =$ event $2^{nd}$ card is spades

## Conditional Probability facts (2/2)

3.  If $A$ and $B$ are independent events ($A \unicode{x2AEB}B$), then $$\mathbb{P}(A|B) = \mathbb{P}(A)$$

4.  $\mathbb{P}(A|B)$ is a probability, meaning that it satisfies the probability axioms. In particular, $$\mathbb{P}(A|B) + \mathbb{P}(A^C|B) = 1$$
